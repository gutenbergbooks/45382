      HE scenes of the war, related by a boy who followed the flag from the
      beginning to the end of the war, must carry with them a sense of accuracy,
      for they are the recollections of actual service. Those books which have
      been written upon the war have, with very few exceptions, been penned from
      the standpoint of mature opinions and experiences. In this work the views
      and struggles of a boy who went into the army, from an honest desire to do
      right, are portrayed. To fight was abhorrent to his nature, but there was
      a call for men who were willing to defend the institutions of his beloved
      land. And that defense was only possible through bloodshed and conflict.
      Tenderly instructed by a loving and gentle mother, whose early home was in
      the South, it was almost a wrenching of her cherished opinions, to give
      him up to fight against her kindred. But her boy did not enter the contest
      with a thought of conquering his fellow-beings, but as a duty which,
      though painful, must be performed. How that dear mother gave him to his
      country, how he marched, and fought, and endured hardships, are here set
      forth in the colors of truth, for it is a true story.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that the boys and girls of to-day and their fathers and mothers may
      follow the varying fortunes of the boy of our story, thus ushered into the
      conflict, with pleasure and profit, is the heartfelt hope of

      OOKS without number have been written upon the Civil War. There will
      probably be many more, for it is a fruitful theme. Many of them are
      faithful and accurate presentations of the great deeds done in that war.
      But whether large or small, they are all imbued with a desire to
      perpetuate that love of our country which should become one of the
      absorbing passions of the soul. It is a truth worth remembering&mdash;that
      the man who is a traitor to his country will be a traitor to all the
      relations of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our land, young as it is, has received an awful baptism of fire and blood.
      It sprang into being amid the anguish of the Revolution, and before it had
      achieved a century of freedom, it was plunged into one of the saddest
      conflicts which ever desolated a nation&mdash;the conflict between
      brothers, speaking the same tongue, living under the same government, and
      enjoying the same great privileges. But from that terrible ordeal it has
      emerged, and we are once more one in aim and purpose, and have taken our
      stand among the proudest nations of the earth, their equal in intelligent
      achievements, religion and progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little book we offer our young readers is the simple story, told in
      plain language, of a boy who was really in the army&mdash;one who left a
      pleasant home, as did thousands of others, a mere lad, loving his native
      land, knowing her need of strong hands and willing hearts to defend her.
      His purpose was noble, his mind fresh and ready for impressions; the
      scenes of those days are as ineffaceable as though written on marble, and
      not even the corroding touch of time can eat them away. So the present
      volume has been penned, that the boys and girls who read its pages may
      know of the hardships and self-sacrifice of the boys of those days&mdash;how
      cheerfully they enlisted to uphold the &ldquo;starry flag,&rdquo; whose folds shall
      ever &ldquo;float o'er the land of the free, and the home of the brave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There are other lessons to be taught, as well as that of courage alone;
      the lessons of patriotism, of sacrifice, of respect for a government that
      offers to all its protection so long as they obey its just and equitable
      laws. No one doubts the courage of our boys, but they must remember that
      there is a higher quality than mere bravery&mdash;regard for human life,
      that' it be not destroyed wantonly, a respect for others' rights and
      opinions, a readiness to submit to discipline, a willingness to yield up
      life when honor and duty demand it. All these thoughts were impressed upon
      the boy of our story, and made him a grander man for their lessons, when
      the pursuits of peace claimed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the boys and girls whose fathers and friends fought that a great
      principle should live, to those whose dear ones fell in battle, or died of
      wounds, to all who read this true history of one boy's life in the army,
      we send forth this picture, the type of a true soldier, who did not love
      war for its noise and glitter, but who conscientiously fought the battles
      of his country because he revered her beneficent institutions. It was
      there that he was taught what true freedom meant, and through all his
      trials, his privations, he kept his faith in God and humanity undimmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was our boy, and of such material heroes are made.

      HE early <span class="pagenum">[017]</span><a name="link017" id="link017"></a>spring
      days of 1861 were dreams of beauty. The skies smiled blandly upon the
      earth, and every heart was glad that the long winter was over, and the
      charms of outdoor life could be enjoyed once more. Surely nature had done
      her part in making men happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      A spirit of unrest and uncertainty, however, brooded in the air. The long
      conflict between opposing ideas, which had waged so long and bitterly in
      politics and churches, and through the columns of the press, had come to a
      focus, and dread murmurs were abroad, of an impending war, and its
      attendant horrors. Men looked in each other's faces, and asked, with sad
      forebodings&mdash;&ldquo;What is coming next?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The South made ample preparations to seize two South Carolina forts,
      Moultrie and Sumter, as early as December, 1860.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lieutenant-Colonel Gardner was the commander of Fort Moultrie, and, loyal
      to the government, he sent to Washington asking for reinforcements to help
      him hold that fort. This request offended the Southern members of
      Congress, who construed it into an insult, and demanded his removal. This
      demand was acceded to by Secretary of War Floyd, and Major Robert Anderson
      of Kentucky was appointed to supersede Colonel Gardner.

      Major Anderson, <span class="pagenum">[018]</span><a name="link018"      id="link018"></a>faithful to the trust reposed in him by the government,
      soon decided that Fort Moultrie could not be held against a vigorous
      assault, and he moved his garrison secretly to Sumter, a fortress across
      the harbor. This fort could not be approached by land, and, consequently,
      from this fact, was deemed more secure against any opposing force. The
      undertaking was a dangerous one. The harbor was full of guard boats,
      vigilant and watchful, and only their supposition that the little rowboats
      containing Major Anderson and his men were laborers going to the other
      fort to work on it, prevented their detection and arrest.

      Moultrie's guns had been trained to protect this transfer in case the
      Major's intention was discovered, and the fort, whose defense rendered the
      gallant Anderson immortal, was occupied by his troops at only twenty
      minutes' notice! We think that was the quickest &ldquo;moving time&rdquo; on record.

      A siege gun which was turned upon Fort Sumter is shown on page 20. Its
      carriage is broken, and it was thus rendered useless by the Confederates,
      when they abandoned the fort in 1864.

      France <span class="pagenum">[019]</span><a name="link019" id="link019"></a>and
      England would not acknowledge the South as an independent nation, but the
      Confederate government did all possible to bring this about by sending
      Messrs. James M. Mason of Virginia and John Slidell of Louisiana to London
      and Paris with the hope that their claims would be recognized. Henry Ward
      Beecher, when in the height of his fame, afterward went to England,
      addressing immense audiences, and setting forth the true condition of
      American affairs.

      The hope of the Southerners was that the government would allow a
      peaceable withdrawal of the dissatisfied States, and that no bloodshed
      would be necessary, but as time went by and the most active preparations
      for keeping them in the Union were made by the general government, they
      commenced hostilities, and the first gun of the war was fired by the
      Confederates under General Beauregard on the morning of April 12, and
      while the officers and men within the fort were eating their breakfast, a
      perpetual bursting <span class="pagenum">[020]</span><a name="link020"      id="link020"></a>of shells and shot kept them awake to the fact that the
      peace had been broken, and war had begun.

      reply on the part of the Union was made by Captain Abner <span

Blockade running was so common it became necessary to fit out out an
expedition to close the most valuable of the openings, Hatteras Inlet.
The first expedition projected for this purpuse was fitted out near
Fortress Monroe and was under the command of Flag Officer Silas H.
Stringham. The engagement lasted three hours with a complete victory for
Stringham, and several blockade runners entered the inlet and were
captured.

The news fell like a pall upon the North. It was impossible so many and
old man urged, that Americans, our own people could be so disloyal. Why
had they done it? What did it mean? And when, in consequence of this
act, President Lincoln ordered them to disperse within twenty days, and
called for 75,000 men from the various States, to enlist to &ldquo;suppress
this combination against the laws,&rdquo; the response came swiftly.
    </p>
    <p>
      In every town and village the patriotic fires were kindled, and boys and

      to uphold their country's flag.

      Women could not fight, but they could organize sewing societies, and work
      untiringly for those who had gone to the front. Many an article found its
      way to the army that was useful, and when blood had been spilled, these

      This longing haunted him by day and night, until it became unbearable. He
      went to his mother, and with earnest words begged her to send him. Alas,
      that mother was not equal to the task. <span class="pagenum">[026]</span><a
      name="link026" id="link026"></a>She was loving, gentle and shrinking, and
      when he urged her to let him go, her answer was&mdash;&ldquo;Ralph, you know not
      what you ask. Do you forget that I am a Southern woman, whose childhoods
      days were spent in that beautiful country? All my people are there. Would
      you have me send my boy away to fight those I love, and whose feelings I
      must share? You are asking too great a sacrifice at my hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother, it is true that you were born and educated there. But did you not
      love my father so dearly that you left your home and all your friends to
      come to the North with him, where I was born?&rdquo;

      A tender smile flitted across her still beautiful face. &ldquo;Yes, I did love
      him,&rdquo; she said softly to herself, &ldquo;and I honor his memory. What shall I
      do?&mdash;I cannot forget my dear childhood's home. It is too hard a
      question for me to decide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me decide for you, mother. You surely love your Northern home and
      friends. The people of the South have fired upon our forts in Charleston
      harbor, and driven the garrison away. I, too, am a Southerner in many
      ways. Are you not my mother, and do you not know I honor every thought or
      wish of yours?&rdquo;
     </p>

      &ldquo;There must be some other way to bring them back, rather than by fighting.
      War is a cruel and unnatural alternative. Why, they will be firing upon

      Ralph <span class="pagenum">[028]</span><a name="link028" id="link028"></a>was
      silent. His heart burned with patriotic fire, and it seemed to him that it
      was his duty to help swell the numbers of those who were ready to respond
      to the President's call. But he also knew that his mother loved her early
      home, and that it seemed to her unnatural for him to be so ready to take
      up arms against &ldquo;her people,&rdquo; and he respected her too deeply to wound her
      willingly. That mother had been gently born, and when she met the young
      Northern lawyer, she had loved him from the first, and cheerfully shared
      his humble but peaceful home. She was now left alone in the world, with
      her three girls and this boy, the youngest. The fortunes of war were too
      varying. She might never see him again, and how could she live without
      him?
    </p>
    <p>
      To Ralph was presented a problem that he was called unexpectedly to solve.
      He pondered over it in the silence of night, and in the busy hours of day.
      Was it right to fly in the face of his beloved mother's prejudices by
      joining the Federal forces? On the one hand he felt that he, too, was
      Southern in feeling and in birth. His father was a Northern man, and he
      would uphold the old flag; but which side it was his duty to join, he
      could not determine. He was resolved to go into one of the two armies. In
      the crisis that had come, it was clearly every one's duty to come to the
      front.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy talked with every one whom he could interest. He was not able to
      study out the problem alone. One of his schoolmates had the proud
      distinction of having an uncle who was a commissioned officer, and he took
      the bold step of meeting him one day when he was walking past his home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; he said timidly, &ldquo;may I speak to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; the officer replied. And then and there he poured forth his
      doubts, his desire to do what was right, his mother's objections&mdash;all,
      he told the waiting gentleman whose opinion he so desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      The officer laid his hand kindly on the boy's shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your wish does you credit. The fortunes of war are too varying for me to
      decide for you. Try and work out the proper answer yourself, and may you
      be helped to make a wise decision.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alas, <span class="pagenum">[029]</span><a name="link029" id="link029"></a>the
      question was too hard for a boy like him to answer. He was humbly trying
      to see where his duty lay, and then he was ready to enlist on whichever
      side called him. On one hand was his mother and her early teachings, on
      the other his dead father, with all his views. &ldquo;What side would <i>he</i>
      choose were he here?&rdquo; was the ever-recurring thought in his anxious brain.

    <p>
      But after weeks of this long, weary struggle, he decided to join the Union
      army. His mother saw that he believed he was shirking a duty, and that he
      longed for action.
    </p>
    <p>
      She thought she would make one more effort to change his purpose. She said
      to him suddenly one day, when she saw his troubled face: &ldquo;Ralph, you are
      only seventeen. You have never been away from your home, and know nothing
      about hardships and privations. Do you think you could face a cannon, and
      know that its deadly mouth might lay you low on the field, mangled and
      torn?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, mother, I never think of such things. If I enlist, I must take my
      chances with the rest. I want to go with the other boys. Eddie Downing and
      George Martin have and are going into camp to-morrow, at Readville.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But will the government accept you? Eddie and George are three or four
      years older than you. There are plenty of men, without taking a boy who is
      his mother's chief comfort.&rdquo;

      &ldquo;I am strong and well. When I come back, you will be the proudest mother
      in the land, to think you sent your boy away. I may go with your blessing,
      may I not? That will protect me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The <span class="pagenum">[031]</span><a name="link031" id="link031"></a>boy's
      eyes were moist with emotion. His mother, with a sigh, gave her reluctant
      consent, and though many a bitter tear was shed in the loneliness of her
      room, she bravely hid them from the boy she loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that the decision was final, she made every preparation for the
      comfort of the boy who was to leave them so soon. His sisters wept
      continually&mdash;not a very cheerful parting, but Ralph was the idol of
      his home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; he said to her a day or two after she had given her consent, &ldquo;do
      not worry about me. I shall do my duty. This war <i>can't</i> last long.
      Then I'll come back to you, and stay at home as long as I live, depend on
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His beaming face half reassured her, and she began to share his
      enthusiasm. He was enrolled as a soldier. Although his youth was at first
      objected to, his earnestness carried the day, and he was told to report at
      Camp Hale at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a real soldier at last! A genuine soldier, who must fight. He did
      not belong to the would-be soldiers, such as they used to call the
      &ldquo;militia,&rdquo; who simply paraded on the open green, or turned out on dress
      occasions, with the curious for an audience, who would watch and be
      astonished at their evolutions and their showy uniforms, when the Fourth
      of July or kindred days made their demands upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his neat-fitting suit of blue, the cap setting jauntily upon his head,
      his musket in hand, and his belt with its bayonet buckled around him, he
      looked so manly that a thrill of pride flashed o'er his mothers face, as
      she looked at her boy, her Ralph, in his &ldquo;soldier clothes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But when the day came for him to leave the only home he had ever known,
      and he turned to take a last look at its plain walls, his heart almost
      failed him. His beloved mother stood in the doorway, her hands pressed
      over her face, while she strove to keep back the choking sobs, as she bade
      her boy&mdash;&ldquo;Good-bye, and may God bless and protect you.&rdquo; Those solemn
      words came back to Ralph in many a lonely hour, and brought him
      consolation and support.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, <span class="pagenum">[032]</span><a name="link032" id="link032"></a>in
      many homes, both North and South, were the heartstrings torn, as mothers
      and sisters bade farewell to the boys in blue and gray, who went to the
      front, to lay down their lives for duty's sake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ralph was a proud boy when he joined his companions in camp, wearing the
      blue uniform, with its shining buttons bearing the U. S. stamp upon them.

      He was naturally retiring, but now he felt as if the eyes of the world
      were upon him. He had taken an important step, and he would show his
      friends and that great big world that he knew exactly what he was doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Camp life was one continual drill&mdash;so it seemed to him. Readville was
      a quiet little town, but its people were ablaze with patriotism, and the
      &ldquo;boys in blue&rdquo; were the recipients of perpetual admiration. Every move
      they made was noticed and approved, and it is not to be wondered at if
      some of them did greedily swallow considerable flattery, which led them to
      assume quite lofty airs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sameness of life in camp soon wearied, and Ralph longed for something
      more stirring. When the bugle call rang out, every man sprang up, and,
      after a hasty ablution, at a second call they made a charge upon their
      breakfast with vehemence, and tin cups and plates rattled in a most
      discordant fashion. Then the drill began; first with musket and rifle, and
      then with the bayonet. A bayonet charge was a fierce reminder of the real
      thing. When men meet the enemy with fixed bayonets, a dreadful slaughter
      may always be counted on. This drilling was kept up at intervals, all
      through the day; first in squads and companies, and then the entire
      regiment would take part in the use of these weapons, and the various
      evolutions that the drill-master taught.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ralph was very anxious to become proficient in their use, and while many
      of the older men grumbled at this work, he kept on, learning at each
      repetition something more of their actual value.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll have to know all about this,&rdquo; said Lieutenant Hopkins to them, or
      you'll be in a nice hole when you're caught out in the field. &ldquo;We don't
      know how soon we may be sent to the front, and then there won't be much
      time for this sort of practice. It'll be march and fight then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Way down in his heart this quiet stripling, hitherto jealously guarded
      from a knowledge of the world by a fond mother and sisters, had his own
      dreams of fame burning brightly and steadily. What if he could plan or
      assist in some grand sortie, and be mentioned <span class="pagenum">[034]</span><a
      name="link034" id="link034"></a>in the dispatches as &ldquo;the gallant private
      of Company K&mdash;&mdash; Mass. Volunteers, whose valor turned the tide
      and carried the day?&rdquo; Then probably he would be summoned before the
      commanding officer, and honors would be thrust upon him. Perhaps, if he
      kept on, he might be a general! What would the dear ones at home say then?
      The picture was too brilliant; his head fairly grew dizzy at the prospect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell you,&rdquo; he said to a comrade, &ldquo;we are in no danger of starving
      here in camp, at any rate, if we don't have much variety.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's so. What's the matter with pork, beans, soup, bread, molasses
      (here he made a wry face), rice and hard tack? If we get enough of these,
      we'll pull through all right,&rdquo; his companion responded cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we sleep as sound as kittens in our wooden bunks, with plenty of
      straw for a bed, and our big army blankets over us,&rdquo; continued Ralph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The pillows might be a little softer,&rdquo; said Harvey Phillips. &ldquo;Overcoats
      doubled up ain't quite as easy shook up as feathers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but our captain tells me that we are living in clover just at
      present. Wait till we go into a battle. Perhaps we'll come out without any
      heads, then we won't need any pillows,&rdquo; laughed Ralph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's true. Your easy times are right here just now,&rdquo; said a &ldquo;vet,&rdquo; who
      had been in many a battle in the far West with the red men, and had &ldquo;smelt
      powder&rdquo; to his heart's content. &ldquo;War looks very pretty on paper, with the
      big fellows at Washington moving the men like they're at a chessboard, but
      wait till the guns speak up on the field, and men to men are hurled
      against each other, to fight like demons. The real thing ain't so
      romantic, let me tell you youngsters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can't frighten us,&rdquo; said Harvey. &ldquo;We are no three months' men. We
      enlisted for the war and we propose to see the war out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys, I tell you war aren't no pastime. It means work, and hardest kind
      of work, at that. It's a great thing to organize an army, and keep its
      various parts in trim. We don't usually <span class="pagenum">[035]</span><a
      name="link035" id="link035"></a>go out to fight the enemy with only a
      flask of powder, and a knapsack filled with soda crackers. There are men
      and horses and ammunition to carry along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who takes care of all these matters?&rdquo; asked Ralph.

      AMP life <span class="pagenum">[038]</span><a name="link038" id="link038"></a>was
      pleasant, aside from the perpetual drilling, marching and countermarching.
      Friends had access to the boys at stated times, little gifts and pledges
      were exchanged, and the time passed swiftly. One day there was great
      excitement. Coffee was swallowed hastily, knapsacks were packed in a
      hurry, arms were brightened up, ammunition was dealt out, and the word ran
      through the camp&mdash;&ldquo;We are ordered to report at Washington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I shall know something of what is going on. Poor mother, she will
      grieve over her absent boy, and fancy me in a thousand dangers. But I will
      write to her often, that will cheer her up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he did. Many a line he scribbled on his knee with a bit of pencil or a
      blackened stick, telling her of his safety and health. These short but
      welcome missives were read over and over, and fondly kissed, the dear
      little messengers of love and hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      The war cloud was growing darker. The government arsenal at Harper's Ferry
      had been burned by Lieutenant Jones, who knew it would lessen its value to
      the Southern forces, who were marching upon the town. The latter, however,
      saved considerable of the government property, and next seized the bridge
      at Point of Rocks, thus circumventing General Butler, who was near
      Baltimore. They also took possession of several trains, which they
      side-tracked into Strasburg, a measure which helped the Confederate train
      service in Virginia very perceptibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ride of the boys in blue to Washington lay through the mountains of
      West Virginia, where nature revels in grand surprises. Many a little cabin
      perched far up the hillside was the home <span class="pagenum">[039]</span><a
      name="link039" id="link039"></a>of those who had shed tears when old John
      Brown was led forth to die. Poor and scanty though their daily fare was,
      they were loyal and true, and the spirit of defiance to the old flag found
      no echoes in their breasts.

      To Ralph the scenery appealed with deep solemnity. He was born in the
      West, where the green seas of the prairies seemed to know <span
      class="pagenum">[040]</span><a name="link040" id="link040"></a>no limit.
      To him hills and valleys, with their somber shadows, were objects of awe.
      He noted the beautiful homes of wealth and taste as he was whirled swiftly
      by on the train. He saw the black faces of slaves working in garden or
      field, and heard their voices as they talked.

      Washington, the capital of the nation, was reached. As they <span
      class="pagenum">[041]</span><a name="link041" id="link041"></a>steamed
      into the depot, and began to unload, Ralph, for the first time since
      leaving home, felt lonely. He saw throngs of people, but all was strange
      and new to him, and his heart sank. The city was full of soldiers waiting
      for orders, so full that it was a puzzle where to quarter them.

      The Government buildings were full to overflowing, they &ldquo;bunked&rdquo;
       every-where, and wild pranks these boys played, their love of fun leading
      them into many a mad frolic. The city was too small for their mischievous
      natures, and it was no uncommon thing to make a trip into the surrounding
      territory, bent on extorting all the sport they might out of what most of
      them regarded as a sort of a gala time. &ldquo;But we are ready whenever we are
      called upon,&rdquo; was their unanimous cry. The shooting of Colonel Ellsworth
      at Alexandria, because he tore down a secession flag, so short a time
      previous, and his prompt avenging, as you remember, had roused them to a
      sense of the hostility which was felt by those who sought to divide the
      North and South. Then the attack of the mob of Baltimore upon the Sixth
      Massachusetts, <span class="pagenum">[042]</span><a name="link042"      id="link042"></a>while being transported from one depot to another, was
      another proof that their brothers of the South had trampled friendly
      feelings beneath their feet, and that the fires of sectional jealousy were
      burning fiercely.

      Their journey lay through a hostile State, and sober faces succeeded the
      jokes and laughter of the past few weeks. The South was plainly up in
      arms, and that &ldquo;rebellion,&rdquo; which the whole North at first thought but the
      task of a few weeks to crush, began to assume the appearance and
      proportions of a long and cruel conflict.

      General Butler was in command of the military department of Virginia.

      &ldquo;Wonder <span class="pagenum">[043]</span><a name="link043" id="link043"></a>if
      that means fight?&rdquo; soliloquized Ralph. &ldquo;The lads say he is a smart lawyer,
      but I don't know as that proves him to be a good fighter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ralph wrote often to that dear mother who was praying for her boy. &ldquo;We
      move to the front to-morrow,&rdquo; so his letter ran. &ldquo;I know how fond you are
      of your boy. I am going to do my duty, I believe. But is it not an awful
      thought that it is no foreign foe we shall meet, but our own people?&mdash;that
      is the sting in it to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The night before the battle the boys slept as calmly as if they were at
      home. At dawn they were called to march, and after an attack upon their
      rations, they began the advance into Virginia. Raw and undisciplined, they
      did not accept the gravity of the situation. They marched along,
      light-hearted and gay, enjoying the change from quiet camp life with all
      the zest of school boys. Many of them fell out of the ranks and picked the
      luscious berries growing thickly by the wayside, while others wastefully
      tossed out the water in their <span class="pagenum">[044]</span><a
      name="link044" id="link044"></a>canteens and filled them with fresh every
      time they came to one of the springs which abounded in that beautiful and
      fertile region.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This isn't hard work,&rdquo; Ralph thought. &ldquo;We are having more fun than ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A halt had been called for a few moments' rest. A few rods from the road a
      dark stream ran slowly by, whose depths no one knew. A swim in its cool
      waters was proposed at any hazard, and, quickly disrobing, some of the
      younger ones plunged in, and were having a merry time, when the roll of
      the drum was heard and the marching was resumed. Here was a fix! The army
      began to move, and a dozen soldiers were still in the stream, who snatched
      up the first garments they saw and hastened to dress. In their confusion
      they had almost to a man seized the wrong clothes, and the fit of some of
      them was ludicrous. But changes were quickly made, and after much
      good-natured &ldquo;chaffing&rdquo; they fell into line, and were as sedate and
      soldierlike as any &ldquo;vet&rdquo; among them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cry, &ldquo;On to Richmond!&rdquo; sounded throughout the land.
    </p>
    <p>
      Officers and soldiers had been massed near Washington long enough, and the
      people, as well as the boys in blue, were impatient tor some results, now
      that an army had been called into being. The soldiers pined for action;
      the people were anxious to know what would be the outcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who commands the Southerners?&rdquo; Ralph asked old &ldquo;Bill&rdquo; Elliott, a soldier
      who had taken quite a fancy to the boy, and was ready to answer his
      questions at all times.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beauregard, the same chap who opened fire on Fort Sumter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what does he propose doing now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, as I am not in his confidence, I can't just tell you, but I 'low
      we're not going to be in the dark long, neither are we likely to be the
      gainers by any move he makes if he can help it. He's got some thirty
      thousand men with him, and we'll have a lively time soon, you bet.&rdquo;

      &ldquo;The <span class="pagenum">[045]</span><a name="link045" id="link045"></a>men

      Ralph laughed. &ldquo;Why, of course I shall. It seems to me this war won't be a
      very long one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not&mdash;you can't tell. But McClellan taught the Johnnies a
      lesson at the 'races' the other day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The 'races?'&rdquo; Ralph's eyes opened wide.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the 'Philippi races,'&rdquo; Bill went on. &ldquo;The Confeds ran so fast from
      our boys at that battle that they dubbed their retreat the 'Philippi
      races,' in honor of the speed they showed. He has been made a general, and
      given the Ohio troops to command. He crossed the Ohio with four regiments
      and banged after the enemy. He found it hard work, for they say Colonel
      Porterfield burned all the bridges. He wasn't long in putting them in
      order, though, and getting over some big reinforcements. He routed them at
      Philippi and at Rich Mountain. Government ought to remember him, I tell
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And it did, for &ldquo;Little Mac,&rdquo; as he was called, was made
      commander-in-chief of the Army of the Potomac. <span class="pagenum">[049]</span><a

      T Washington all sorts of rumors were plenty. It was generally known,
      however, that General Beauregard was making for Bull Run, where the stream
      presented a natural barrier. General McDowell left Washington with a
      force, whose accompaniments of civilians, following the marching columns
      on foot, reporters, congressmen and idle sight-seers in carriages, was a
      motley and curious sight. Everyone declared this to be the battle which
      was to close out the rebellion, and all were jubilant at the prospect.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the army pressed under the brave McDowell, who was planning to execute
      a flank movement upon the Confederates' left. A two hours' engagement
      routed the Rebels, who fled before the Union charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The victory seemed to the Federal troops an easy one, but Generals
      Johnston and Beauregard took the field in person, and, planting their
      artillery in a piece of woods, they held the open plateau across which the
      Federals were advancing, wholly at their mercy. General McDowell could see
      nothing of this, owing to the shape of the ground, only by mounting to the
      top of the Henry House, where they took their stand, and where the attack
      was resumed in the afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">[051]</span><a name="link051" id="link051"></a>
      The men on both sides were raw troops; they had not become the machines
      that after fighting made them. This was to most of them their first
      encounter, and as shot and shell flew rapidly by them, as the Union men
      advanced over the open ground upon the enemy, who were concealed within
      the woods, only to be picked off, one by one, by the Confederate
      sharpshooters, who took the gunners at their batteries, they became
      disheartened.

      fight in the forenoon had exhausted them, and they were unprepared for the
      work still to be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      The battle was fierce; men were falling like hail, in all the agonies of
      death. Here a drummer boy was lying face downward, his stiff hand
      clutching the stick whose strokes would never wake the echoes again. There
      an officer, his uniform dyed with blood, lay prostrate on the ground, his
      horse half across his stiffening body, while at every turn the wounded
      were huddled together, in the positions in which they fell.

      Ralph's heart turned sick, as he saw the brave fellows who manned the
      batteries tumbling over each other, many of them shot through the heart,
      as the Confederates, tempted by their success, stole nearer to the guns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Griffin, who made the sad mistake of thinking the troops were his
      own men coming to his aid, permitted the nearer approach of the
      Confederates. He discovered his error when a volley of musketry took
      nearly every gunner and stretched Lieutenant Ramsay low in death, as the
      rebels rushed in and seized the guns.

    <p>
      The <span class="pagenum">[054]</span><a name="link054" id="link054"></a>fighting
      went pluckily on; both sides were in deadly earnest. The batteries seemed
      to be the coveted prize, and they were taken and retaken, first by one
      army, and then the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Worn and harassed, in the confusion that ensued, regiments and companies
      became mixed, and thousands of men lost track of their companies and
      wandered about, not knowing where they belonged.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the dense smoke that covered the battle ground, Ralph became lost, and,
      making a short turn, found a clump of trees with a thick growth of
      underbrush. He heard voices, and threw himself flat upon the ground,
      determined not to be taken prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wonder what General Beauregard's next move will be?&rdquo; The tones were low
      and even.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Lieutenant, we cannot know at present, but it is certain we have
      taught the Yanks a lesson this day. They'll never forget Johnston's
      brigade. They were so sure of whipping us. It was a hot battle, and three
      or four times I thought we had lost. Those fellows fight well, but they're
      no match for the South. What's the matter over there? See, our men are
      retreating. Don't they know we've won the day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was true. So many times had the victory changed hands, that it was hard
      to tell who had won finally and it looked as if the Confederate line was
      breaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeff Davis' heart sank as he came up from Manassas and found that hundreds
      of Confederates, under the impulse of fear, were fleeing to the rear. He
      kept on, only to find that the Northern army was in full retreat, and the
      battle of Bull Run was a bitter defeat for the Federals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ralph lay there in ambush, pale with dread. He feared capture more than
      death. He rose quickly as the two officers galloped away, to stay their
      men, and looked upon the scene. Lines of men in blue and gray stretched
      away in the distance, while the noise of the guns, the neighing of
      wounded, horses, the huzzas of the victors, drowning the groans of the
      wounded, made him faint with horror, and his cheeks grew white as he saw
      men lying on their backs, their glassy eyes staring up to the sky, <span
      class="pagenum">[055]</span><a name="link055" id="link055"></a>their faces
      ghastly and white, and peaceful, or else distorted with pain. Here a
      wounded soldier would half raise himself on one arm, and beg for water,
      while others, bleeding and dying, lay uncomplainingly, their eyes fixed on
      the blue sky, which nevermore would greet their waking vision.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the dim light he saw all this, and knew not where to go. The terrible
      sights and hideous silence which succeeded the noise of conflict sickened
      him, and Ralph, the brave soldier boy, actually fainted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's this? Why, it's Ralph! Is he killed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tones sounded, to the boy's benumbed senses, far away, as a <span
      class="pagenum">[056]</span><a name="link056" id="link056"></a>heavily
      bearded man knelt down and placed his hand upon his heart. He saw it was
      Bill, and the flush of mortification mounted to his brow, as he tried to
      rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was weak&mdash;dizzy&mdash;and I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know all about it!&rdquo; good-humoredly laughed Bill Elliott, for he it was.
      &ldquo;This is your first appearance, and you had a sort of a stage fright.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ralph bit his lips with vexation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that's nothing. You'll make a better showing next time. You'll live
      to be a brigadier-general. But I was kinder rattled myself when I saw you
      so still. I didn't know but some fellow had tuk good aim at you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not hurt in the least, Bill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, boy, come on. We've been whipped bad, and are most unpleasantly
      nigh those fellows with the guns over thar, and as I'm pretty tall, they
      might choose me for a mark, just to keep their hands in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Federal army, broken and defeated, straggled back to Washington,
      footsore, dirty and hungry. No battle during the war was fought with more
      desperation, and bravery was shown by both sides&mdash;the Union and the
      Confederate.
    </p>
    <p>
      And though the defeat of General McDowell's forces was a blow to the pride
      of the North, it carried a valuable lesson; that the South would not be
      persuaded back to its old allegiance.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the boys of this generation slavery is almost a myth. But when the
      Civil War broke out the blacks were held in bondage to masters who had
      acquired them by purchase or inheritance, and thus they represented
      property or wealth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The South bitterly resented any interference with an institution which
      many of them honestly regarded as divine. In the North opinion was
      divided, some believing slavery to be wrong, but that it would gradually
      die out. All classes were unwilling that it should be extended into new
      territory.
    </p>
    <p>
      This difference of opinion led to the conflict which caused brave men to
      take up arms and arrayed brother against brother, in defense of what each
      believed to be just and fair.

      LD Bill was a little fearful, spite of Ralph's protestations, <span
      class="pagenum">[058]</span><a name="link058" id="link058"></a>lest his
      boy, as he dubbed him, was going to show the white feather, after all, and
      so he kept him well under his eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want the tarnal little rascal skipping, for it 'ud go hard with
      him to be caught. They'd shoot him sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he didn't know the true mettle of the boy. He was no coward, if he did
      turn sick at the scenes of his first battle, and he was a lad of honor,
      and would have died before he would leave his post.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he felt a little down-hearted when orders came for a detail from
      Company K to turn out for picket duty. The men themselves felt rather blue
      at this news, for they were worn out and disheartened by their late
      tussle, but they didn't expect their wishes would be considered in the
      matter. Ralph's eyes gleamed with joy, for he longed for adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bill, I believe you think I am cowardly. You'll change your mind soon, I
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That individual grimly responded: &ldquo;Picket duty is a very cheerful way of
      passing one's time, but I guess you'll do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The picket line was twelve miles distant, and as the men got into line,
      the air and the excitement infused courage into Ralph's breast. They had
      been ordered out to relieve a regiment which had seen some hard work, and
      who were anxious to get into shelter.

      The newcomers were told what spots needed the most watching, and as soon
      as they were stationed at their posts and received <span class="pagenum">[060]</span><a
      name="link060" id="link060"></a>the necessary instructions, they settled
      down to the importance of the duty assigned them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woods lay behind them, and each picket sought their friendly shelter,
      well aware that any &ldquo;change of base&rdquo; on their part would be an invitation
      to the enemy to pick them off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Memories of home filled Ralph's breast. The night was dark and starless. A
      strong wind blew at intervals, now howling dismally through the trees, and
      then shifting its course, rushing down the bank, as if it would rend the
      earth and the tall grass in its anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if mother thinks of her soldier boy,&rdquo; he pondered.
    </p>
    <p>
      When does a mother ever cease to think of and pray for her children?
    </p>
    <p>
      The night wore on. Perfect quiet reigned, and Ralph began to consider
      picket duty not half so risky as Old Bill called it, after all. But as he
      kept his eyes on the opposite bank, where the &ldquo;Johnnies&rdquo; were, he fancied
      he saw a small dark object creeping through the grass down to the river,
      where it seemed to be looking up and down its shore. His heart beat
      fiercely. What was it? he asked himself. Was it a man or some animal
      hiding in the grass? If it were a reb, he would be shot dead, at the least
      move on his part&mdash;that he well knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am afraid you will not think my boy was much of a hero, but the truth
      is, he was very much in love with life, as all young people should be,
      and, though willing to do his whole duty, he could not help feeling a
      trifle nervous about his surroundings, so he stooped quickly down behind a
      tall bush that appeared to be growing there just for his benefit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The object on which his gaze was fixed seemed so small that he almost
      laughed aloud at his own fears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it's only a dog that's strayed into camp,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wonder if they fatten him on hard tack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His gaze was riveted upon the dark mass, and his surprise nearly found
      vent in a low whistle, which he speedily checked, as he saw a man or a boy
      steal noiselessly along the bank, till he came <span class="pagenum">[061]</span><a
      name="link061" id="link061"></a>to a place where the grass was tangled and
      thick, and stooping down he pulled a wide board from its hiding-place, and
      picking up a long piece of wood which lay there, he stepped on the plank
      and commenced to paddle across the stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ralph lay in the grass behind the bush, breathlessly watching the
      approaching figure. Suddenly a dog began to bark on the opposite shore,
      and the man on the plank gave utterance to a low, angry exclamation. The
      dog stopped barking, and the stranger came slowly on, till his novel craft
      touched the shore within five feet of Ralph.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw to his amazement that it was a boy, even younger than himself, it
      seemed in the dim light, and he waited breathlessly till he came closer,
      and was halted by Ralph's gun, which he brought sharply against the
      other's breast, while his own was on fire with excitement, as he cried
      aloud&mdash;&ldquo;Halt&mdash;you are my prisoner!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment these two boys faced each other; then the stranger threw his
      head proudly back, and, with a gesture of impatience, replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not be made a prisoner&mdash;I am merely going about my own
      business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that business is to spy upon our lines!&rdquo; Ralph said hotly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take me to your superior officer. I can soon convince him that I am doing
      no harm,&rdquo; answered the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      A stir ran through the picket lines, as the news was passed on that a
      rebel spy had been captured, and soon the lad, whose proud carriage and
      haughty face involuntarily commanded attention, was at headquarters, where
      to all questioning he remained dumb, after telling an apparently truthful
      story that he was crossing the river to visit an old uncle, and knew
      nothing of the movements of either army.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This 'old uncle' is one I fancy we'd better try to unearth,&rdquo; said Colonel
      Tuttle. &ldquo;His acquaintance would be worth cultivating.&rdquo; <span

      The boy would give no further account of himself. His frank, boyish face
      and manly bearing impressed the officer of the day favorably, and he
      muttered to himself&mdash;&ldquo;Wonder if he is a spy. If all the Johnnies are
      as brave and resolute as this youth we'll have to work hard to conquer
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An opinion which he found cause to verify often.

      OU'RE in <span class="pagenum">[063]</span><a name="link063" id="link063"></a>luck,
      my boy,&rdquo; and Bill Elliott's face showed genuine pleasure as he shook hands
      with Ralph. &ldquo;You are to show yourself at headquarters and receive your
      reward, as the good boys in story books always do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An orderly came up to Ralph, and said:&mdash;&ldquo;You are wanted at
      headquarters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ralph proceeded to the officers' tent. For the first time he stood in the
      presence of his commanding officers, and as he saluted respectfully, a
      tall, kindly-faced man looked at him with some surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How old are you?&rdquo; was the abrupt query, as the officer looked in the
      beardless face of the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nearly eighteen, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you seen any service yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was at Bull Run.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fine face clouded with sadness. &ldquo;That was hard and tedious fighting.
      You brought in a prisoner last night, whom we have strong reasons to
      believe is a rebel spy. You have shown two qualities befitting a soldier&mdash;pluck
      and forgetfulness of self. Your captain commends you to me, and I have
      thought proper to make you a corporal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ralph's heart beat loud and fast. What had he done to deserve this honor?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your warrant will be handed to you, and you are expected to attend
      strictly to all its requirements.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To a general or a colonel the promotion would not seem very exalted; but
      to this boy, who could not realize why he had been selected, it was as if
      he had suddenly been lifted into the seventh <span class="pagenum">[064]</span><a
      name="link064" id="link064"></a>heaven To be sure, it only meant two
      stripes on his jacket sleeve, and a trifle of authority, but it also meant
      encouragement and notice from his superiors, He could not answer, but,
      bowing low, he left the tent.

      &ldquo;A board of inquiry must be appointed at once, and we'll see what this lad
      whom Corporal Gregory brought in is doing within our lines.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy was marched before them, but he parried all their questions, and
      maintained a resolute and fearless mien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have told you the truth,&rdquo; he said proudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was going to make a visit when I was seized. You see I have no
      weapons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spies do not always carry arms. Papers are more to their taste. You say
      you came to see an uncle. Where does he live? Why did you visit him at
      night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew <span class="pagenum">[065]</span><a name="link065" id="link065"></a>that
      the enemy lay near us, and I didn't want to be taken prisoner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is this uncle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He lives back of the bluff, on the right hand side of the road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll invite him into our camp, and see if he'll own the relationship.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <p>
      The boy's face flushed with wounded pride, as he answered scornfully:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We call our old servants uncle and aunt. He is an old colored man, and
      lives on this side of the river&mdash;one of our old slaves, whom my
      father freed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll send you to the guard-house until more is known about you,&rdquo; was the
      stern retort.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy was removed to the guard-house. To Ralph he was <span
      class="pagenum">[066]</span><a name="link066" id="link066"></a>an object
      of much interest. His sympathies went out to him and he longed to say
      something comforting.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so when his turn to act as corporal of the guard, with the abrupt
      frankness of youth, he blurted out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What were you doing over here the other night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0050" id="linkimage-0050"> </a>

    <p>
      &ldquo;I have given an account of myself to your superiors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be so lofty. I don't mean to be inquisitive, but I thought you
      might like to know that I am awful sorry I brought you into this trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boys face softened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know as you could do anything else under the circumstances. <span
      class="pagenum">[067]</span><a name="link067" id="link067"></a>I suppose,
      in fact, I know, I'd have done just as you did. Perhaps worse,&rdquo; he
      muttered. &ldquo;I might have shot you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you don't hold any grudge against me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I can't pretend that I'm grateful to you for my detention in this
      hole, but I can't blame you, either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you really going to see the old slave you told the colonel about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An indescribable expression flitted across the boy's features. &ldquo;I said so
      once. My word is usually taken, where I am known. Why do you ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, from curiosity, I suppose. You look too young to be very dangerous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm as old as you are. You look too young to be carrying arms against
      your countrymen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'm going to help put down this rebellion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A hard job you've selected. It is not a rebellion; it's an uprising
      against meddlesome Yankee interference.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ralph's eyes flashed fire. &ldquo;You don't mean to say that you justify the
      South, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I not only justify it, but am proud to belong to a people who can never
      be subdued. Your people are trying to force us to give up our rights, but
      we won't be driven. We have thousands of men in the field, who do not know
      how to fear. And when their places are vacant, more are waiting to fill
      them. We despise the North, and want to be a separate people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You despise a government that has always protected you in all your
      rights. You have no cause for wishing to be disunited. How dare you talk
      so to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Dare?' Am I not your equal? Why should I not speak when I am insulted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't talk treason to me again, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a prisoner,&rdquo; the boy said, sadly, &ldquo;innocent of any crime, surrounded
      by foes and powerless. Were it not so you would not give me a defiance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ralph's conscience smote him. It did appear as if the odds were on <span
      class="pagenum">[068]</span><a name="link068" id="link068"></a>his side,
      and with the quick generosity of youth he said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry for you. We will not quarrel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not to be outdone in generosity, the other replied&mdash;&ldquo;I believe you;
      but we had better not talk about it any more, for we can never agree, and
      we are both hot-headed. You see affairs in a different light from what I
      do, that is all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next day the youth was rigidly examined. He gave his name as Charles
      Arlington, stated that he was merely crossing the river to look after the
      old slave; that he had chosen the night-time as he heard the Union pickets
      were thrown out, and he did not think, with his knowledge of the stream,
      that he would be captured in the darkness. Meantime, the soldiers had been
      searching, and had found an old half imbecile negro in a little cabin half
      a mile back from the river, whom they brought into camp, shaking with
      fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old man,&rdquo; one of the soldiers said, &ldquo;do you know this boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yas, honey. I knows him well. I'se old Marsa Thomas' boy. I bin on his
      old plantation since he was a baby. His mud-der was one of de&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, we don't care who his mother was. What do you know about the boy
      standing there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yas, yas, I knows lots. Why, he was de littlest pickaninny of de hull
      lot, and his father he say to me, 'Jim'&mdash;I was young and strong den&mdash;'Jim,
      dis yere boy's gwine to be your young mastah some day, if he ebber grows
      big enuff. And I tole him de sweetest posies were always small, like de
      vi'lets and lilies ob de valley, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You black rascal, we don't want a dissertation on flowers. Tell us about
      the young man standing there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yas, marsa, but you tole me to tell you all 'bout him, and doan't I hab
      to begin at the beginning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, go on,&rdquo; the Colonel interposed. <span class="pagenum">[069]</span><a

      &ldquo;Dat ar chile dere was de idle of Massa Thomas' heart. My old woman,

     </p>
    <p>
      The old man's withered features shone with a light that was beautiful; his
      utterance was choked, and the tears rolled down his black cheeks as his
      simple eloquence found its way to the hearts of those who heard him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sergeant, release the boy and let him go home. And while we stay here,
      see that the old man is not molested.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Praise de Lawd! Bress you for yore kindness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy bowed courteously to the Colonel, and with a look of gratitude he
      passed out of the officer's tent, with the old man hobbling after him. As
      he approached Ralph he said, &ldquo;Goodbye. We may meet again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not all danger and dread with the boys in the army. Weeks passed
      swiftly, and fun reigned in camp. The gypsy life held charms for them such
      as no indoor employment could offer. The men were hardy and strong, and
      with light hearts talked of the battles yet in store for them. And when
      jests were exchanged, often after having come from a scene of carnage, it
      would be hard to believe that these same men were ready to respond at any
      moment if summoned by the long roll of the drum into action.

    <p>
      In <span class="pagenum">[071]</span><a name="link071" id="link071"></a>the
      early part of the war many little conveniences were provided for the rank
      and file, among them being tents for shelter, which did not keep out the
      cold, however, and many a man died from disease who would have lived to
      fight, had he been properly housed. The second winter, however, many huts
      were put up, rough enough, but better calculated to withstand the cold
      than canvas.

      Each company had a &ldquo;cook tent&rdquo; and a cook, generally selected from the
      men, the officers boasting a &ldquo;cullered individual&rdquo; who was always,
      according to his own account, a &ldquo;perfeshunal.&rdquo; The culinary department was
      ever a point of interest to the men, whose appetites were never so dainty
      that they failed to enjoy their daily rations. No soldier, no matter from
      what part of the North he came, <span class="pagenum">[072]</span><a
      name="link072" id="link072"></a>ever turned up his nose at the beans,

      The hint was always taken, and alas, for the poor farmer who had a nice
      hen-roost, or a young porker in the sty. They had no regard for property
      rights, and though they were not supposed to forage, except under orders,
      yet the temptation was too strong to be resisted.

      But Ralph could not see the funny side of these depredations. To him it
      was a clear wrong to take what did not belong to them. He never would join
      them in these expeditions, a course which exposed him to much ridicule for
      his &ldquo;pious notions,&rdquo; but which had no effect upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Often their zeal in this direction brought its own punishment. On one of
      these forays a long-legged, awkward fellow, who could outrun the fastest
      chicken, chased an anxious hen into a thicket, where the grass was long
      and rank. As he peered round for his game he spied a dozen or so eggs
      shining in the sun. &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;my lady hen is stealing a nest. Well,
      they look white and fresh, and I'll just confiscate them.&rdquo; His pockets
      were full of sweet potatoes, he had a brace ot chickens slung over his
      shoulders, he had lost his handkerchief, if he ever owned one, and the
      problem was how to hold possession of the coveted prize.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know how I'll fix it. I'll put them in my cap. I can carry them all
      right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The eggs were tenderly deposited therein, and he started for camp. He
      heard the boys who were still engaged in the chase <span class="pagenum">[074]</span><a
      name="link074" id="link074"></a>laughing boisterously, and saw Rob
      Douglass, one of the new recruits, with a rope tied to one of the hind
      legs of a monstrous pig, who was jerking him right and left, in quite an
      unmilitary fashion. Now he was nearly on the animal's back, and next he
      was measuring his length on the ground, but he never once released the
      rope, while the shouts and cheers of the boys who were watching the
      contest made Rob more determined than ever to land his prize at the cook's
      tent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zach Smith joined in the merriment and began to chaff Rob, whose face was
      grimy with perspiration, while his dust-covered clothes looked as though a
      good brushing and a few stitches would improve them materially.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing Zach he called to him to help haul in the &ldquo;critter.&rdquo; The latter
      started toward him, but Mrs. Piggie was of the same mind, for she turned
      quickly and ran between his legs. Zach lost his balance and fell, and as
      he instinctively shot out his hands to save his eggs his head struck them
      squarely, while the liquid streaming down his face and neck sent forth
      such an odor that the men, who had inhaled many strange ones since leaving
      home, voted unanimously that that particular one &ldquo;beat anything on
      record.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zach made his way back to his tent, followed by the jibes of his comrades,

      OYS,&rdquo; said <span class="pagenum">[075]</span><a name="link075" id="link075"></a>Lieutenant
      Graves, &ldquo;we have our orders to turn out and show what we are made of. You
      know General McClellan has command of the Army of Virginia, and he thinks
      we've been rusting here long enough; so we're to help General Stone in
      drawing out the enemy. They've so far kept in hiding, and we've got to
      force them out into a square and open fight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The General thinks we're spoiling for a battle, doesn't he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so. Anyway, we are to cross the Potomac at Conrad's Ferry and
      wake 'em up. General McCall has his hands full watching the river
      crossings, and we must help him do it.&rdquo; This was good news to most of the
      men, who had grown tired of inaction. The long summer had worn away, and
      Ralph had often slipped away from camp and run into the negro cabins near
      by, where he was sure of a nice piece of hoe cake, baked on the hearth.
      The garrulous darkeys liked to see Ralph coming, and many a question they
      put to him which he could scarcely answer, so little did he know of the
      true state of affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are few idle moments in camp, for the duties of the soldier are too
      numerous to afford him that leisure which permits of homesickness. He has
      letters to write home, old ones to read; then, too, his spare time is
      occupied in looking for something to eat which his knapsack doesn't hold&mdash;not
      because his rations are scanty, or he is hungry, but he grows tired of the
      regular diet. He is always doing duty, police or fatigue, and the
      perpetual drilling, all keep him busy.

      Mending clothes became quite an art among the soldiers, and the manner in
      which some of them darned their stockings would reflect credit upon <span

      Ralph was very fond of running into old &ldquo;Aunt Judah's&rdquo; cabin, for her
      &ldquo;pones&rdquo; were especially toothsome. The old negress was not handsome&mdash;her
      black skin was shriveled and seamed with age; she was nearly blind, but
      she was an admirable cook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Massa,&rdquo; she said to Ralph one day, when she had filled his knapsack with
      smoking hot pone and luscious sweet potatoes, whose pulp was as golden as
      the sunflower's petals,&mdash;&ldquo;I'se been pondering in my own min' and I

     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;De Union? What you mean by dat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Union&mdash;the States. There are thirty-five States, and how many
      slabes does he own?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None at all. We don't have slaves up North.&rdquo;

      &ldquo;We don't grow any cotton, and all our work is done by people whom we hire

      The old slave's eyes opened wide with curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when dey gets sassy, does de oberseer whip 'em?&rdquo; Ralph laughed
      heartily as he thought of the suit for assault and battery whipping a
      servant up North would bring about. Here was an old colored woman as
      ignorant of her relationship to the great tide of humanity as a child.
      Born in the West in a little village where no negroes were to be found, he
      had seldom met one.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old woman seemed to be talking to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It pears to me dey must be dissbedient and sassy sumtimes. All niggers
      are. Wonder how dey makes dem mind. When dey runs across a right smart
      uppish cullered pusson how do dey settle wid him? Did you say, massa, dey
      neber whip dem?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, auntie, they never do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Judah shook her head doubtingly. &ldquo;Massa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The one man governs the whole of them. Your old masters didn't like the
      man who was chosen, and so they said they wouldn't stay in the Union to be
      governed by him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is dat man a big man? Does he b'long to a good family?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was plain to her the difference between servants North and South? To him
      slavery was a mere name. He knew nothing of its blighting understand how
      dreary and hopeless the life of a &ldquo;chattel&rdquo; broke <span class="pagenum">[080]</span><a
      name="link080" id="link080"></a>out suddenly, &ldquo;dey flogs dem down here;
      dey has to, sumtimes. I neber was struck a blow. I was a house servant,
      but my man worked on de plantation. 'Diamond Joe,' dey called him; he was
      lashed ebery now and den, and I tink it made him ugly. He was a likely
      boy. Wy, massa used to 'clar if he wan't so stubbon, jess like one of our
      plantation mules, he wouldn't take de price of two boys for him, for he
      could hoe and pick mo' cotton dan any 'mount of boys. His skin was as
      shiny as de satin in Missus' dress, and dark, and he was tall like de
      poplar trees, and strong and big. Joe lubbed me in dose days.&rdquo;

      Ralph looked at her wonderingly. Here was a new thought. Did those uncouth
      black folks care for each other as white people did? Were they capable of
      attachments? She was almost hideous&mdash;had she ever been young?
    </p>
    <p>
      A tear rolled down Aunt Judah's withered cheek, and she seemed to be
      looking far away. She was silent so long that Ralph began to be impatient
      to get back to camp with his knapsack full of good things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, auntie, where is Joe now? He must be pretty old by this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A solemn look stole over her features, and looking up to where the blue
      sky showed through the chinks in the little cabin roof, she said&mdash;

      sweetness. It was so bright my heart was singing a song, and Missus Flora
      wanted to be druv to town to buy some nice tings for de little missie's
      birfday party. Massa <span class="pagenum">[082]</span><a name="link082"      id="link082"></a>say 'Joe, Dicks got a sick hoss to 'tend you hitch up de

      had tuk de little lady out on de lawn&mdash;dat he cudn't dribe dem
      speerited critters, fur he had burnt his hands roasting corn in de ashes
      de night afore. 'Don't stan dar, you brack rascal,' massa said, fur he

      oh, massa, I shall neber forget de awful night dat fell, and no Joe, nor
      no missus, nor no carridge and hosses cumd home. Massa was wild. He tore
      up and down de lawn, running here and shouting dar, and sending fust one
      nigger, den anudder, to the neighbors' plantations to see if missie had
      dun gone visiting at any ob dem. Den he called fur Dick and his white

      class="pagenum">[087]</span><a name="link087" id="link087"></a>went back
      to camp with a sad heart. When he entered the camp he found the men
      gathered in knots, discussing the news they had just received of a coming
      engagement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are we going out for?&rdquo; asked a new man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So as to give the rebs a chance to lay us out, or be laid out themselves.
      What do you suppose we go to war for?&rdquo;
     </p>

    <p>
      Old Bill's gruff tones nettled the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It don't hurt you to answer a civil question, does it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, not exactly. You see General McCall has had an advance guard out
      reconnoitering, but he can't persuade the boys over on the Virginia side
      to show up on open ground. They say there's a big force of Confeds at
      Leesburg, five miles or so back from the river.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This will be my first battle,&rdquo; the new recruit said, with a sigh, &ldquo;but I
      don't expect it'll be my last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's right&mdash;never say die. The man who is a little chicken-hearted
      at first, often turns out to be the most courageous soldier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember reading once,&rdquo; Ralph interposed, &ldquo;that at some charge on a
      battery in one of the battles Napoleon fought when the odds were greatly
      against him, his attention was called by one of his officers to the
      cowardice of one poor fellow who was pressing on, up to the cannon's
      mouth. His knees were shaking, <span class="pagenum">[088]</span><a
      name="link088" id="link088"></a>his eyes bulged out, and he gave every
      evidence of being terror-stricken. But his gaze was fixed on the coveted
      point, his teeth were set hard, and he kept resolutely on. 'That man is
      not a coward,' said the great general; 'he sees that his life is in
      danger, and still he does not shrink from his duty, but faces death like a
      man. He will be shot before he yields.&rdquo;
     </p>

      &ldquo;But the soldier was not wounded. He lived to become an officer in the
      very regiment which one would have expected to see disgraced by his
      cowardice, and won great fame through his heroic bravery in after
      engagements.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; said Old Bill, who was always the spokesman for the <span
      class="pagenum">[089]</span><a name="link089" id="link089"></a>party, &ldquo;the
      'Little Corporal'&mdash;that's Napoleon Bonaparte,&rdquo; he continued in an
      aside to the new man, who made a wry face at being singled out for an
      explanation&mdash;&ldquo;was right. It's agin human nature not to feel a little
      shaky when you are going into your first battle. It's how you do your duty
      that settles your standing. If you attend to that no one can blame you for
      having a leetle private fear of your own.&rdquo;

    <p>
      HASTY <span class="pagenum">[090]</span><a name="link090" id="link090"></a>breakfast,
      with a rigid inspection of their muskets, and a hurried packing of
      knapsacks, preceded the long role of the drum, the signal to be up and
      doing. The sight of a body of soldiers with their glittering arms and
      tasty uniforms is inspiriting, and dull and cold must be the bosom that
      does not leap quicker at the thought that he belongs to this grand whole.
      Ralph felt a thrill of exultation as he realized that he was a part and
      parcel of the men who were massed on the bank of the Potomac that bright
      October day. There were Ralph's regiment of Massachusetts men, the
      Forty-second New York, Seventy-first Pennsylvania and a Rhode Island
      battery, counting, in all, some 2,000 men, watching for a chance to cross
      at an island which lay there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day was beautiful&mdash;the sun poured down his warm beams, for in
      that region the winter is late. Many were the openly spoken murmurs of
      impatience, however, on the part of the men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall never get across till doomsday,&rdquo; Bill Elliott said to Ralph.
      &ldquo;Look at our men, over 2,000 of them, and we've only got two or three old
      boats to carry us over. With all due respect to General McClellan, I think
      he's made a great big mistake, as General Stone will find to his cost
      before we're over. The Johnnies can see all we're doing and get all ready
      for us. Why, it'll be dead easy for them to receive us in fine shape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are having hard work with that battery, getting it up the bluff. See
      how they slip at every step.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And as Ralph watched the battery being dragged up with prodigious exertion
      his heart felt heavy, and he, too, began to fear there was an oversight
      somewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0070" id="linkimage-0070"> </a>

    <p>
      At <span class="pagenum">[091]</span><a name="link091" id="link091"></a>the
      top of the bluff lay a broad field of about ten acres, hemmed in on all
      sides by thick woods, so dense that neither infantry nor artillery could
      penetrate them in line. Colonel Baker was given entire command of all the
      troops. Then began a desperate and gallant attempt, which the Confederates
      met, dashing out from the timber, and though the Federals fired round
      after round from their battery, it was a hopeless conflict, for the rebel
      sharpshooters picked off their gunners, one after another, and the pieces
      were left useless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still <span class="pagenum">[092]</span><a name="link092" id="link092"></a>on
      the Union forces pressed, to be met by a heavy body of infantry, whose hot
      fire cut them down. For two hours they stood their ground gallantly, and
      returned the fire with spirit. Suddenly an officer riding a splendid
      horse, whose snowy sides were covered with foam, dashed out of the woods,
      and coming toward them, waving his sword over his head, he beckoned the
      Union forces forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Baker took new courage; he thought he recognized General Johnston
      in the horseman, and wildly cheering to his command to follow, he pressed
      forward, hoping at last he should meet the enemy in an open fight. But he
      was met by a fierce onset of the Confederates, who came on with tremendous
      force. Like a solid wall they met the Federals, and as part of the
      latter's columns charged, Colonel Baker received the whole contents of a
      revolver in the hands of one of the rebels, and fell dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      His body was rescued through the bravery of Captain Beiral and his
      company, who fought their way back through the thickest of the opposing
      force, and with desperate courage rescued the body of their dead
      commander, and conveyed it to the island. At once the rout began, and the
      Union forces were driven back, down the steep clay bluffs, one hundred
      feet high, falling, jumping down, pushed by the Confederates, who followed
      at their heels, killing and taking prisoners.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an awful spectacle. Men whose courage could not be doubted, were
      panic-stricken, and throwing away coats, muskets, and everything that
      could impede them, plunged into the river, whose rapid current overwhelmed
      them, and to their shrieks as they drowned, was added the rapid firing of
      the Confederates on the cliff above, the roar of the artillery, the cries
      of the wounded, making a scene of horror which cannot be described. The
      imagination alone can fill in the picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the incidents of this day may be mentioned a desertion of one of the
      regiments by its colonel, who swam the river on horseback, thus making his
      escape. Many took to a boat, which was quickly filled, and as quickly sunk
      with every soul. A <span class="pagenum">[093]</span><a name="link093"      id="link093"></a>captain in the Fifteenth Massachusetts came to the rescue
      of the fleeing Federals, with two companies, and charged up the hill, only
      to see how little help he could give, and a few moments decided him to
      wave his handkerchief, and surrender to the Confederates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dispirited and weary, the remnant of the troops moved back to camp. Their
      loss had been heavy. Over five hundred soldiers had been captured by the
      Confederates, Colonel Baker had been shot, and they had lost arms,
      ammunition and clothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Corporal Ralph Gregory had shown coolness and clearheaded courage, equal
      to the oldest and bravest. When the battle began, the color-sergeant had
      received a ball in the breast, and had fallen dead. Seizing the flag from
      his stiffening fingers, Ralph rushed to the front, and held it manfully,
      through the storm of bullets that riddled its folds, and clinging
      desperately to it, he carried it proudly and safely, soiled and torn, but
      not disgraced.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his strength was not equal to his courage, and handing it to a
      stalwart comrade whose arm was more powerful, he bade him to &ldquo;protect it
      from capture.&rdquo; The colors went back to camp, and with them, went the story
      of the boy's bravery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ralph was weak, his nerves were unstrung. His ears still echoed the noise
      and confusion of the battle that had not yet died away. Still the Union
      men were fleeing, pursued closely by their enemy, who wounded them with
      muskets and swords, as they ran. The agonized shrieks of those who met
      their death in the swift-flowing stream rang in his ears with fearful
      distinctness, and he vaguely wondered if he would ever cease to hear them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was unnerved. It was not cowardice, but the reaction that so often
      follows times of great excitement. Exhaustion, complete and unavoidable,
      had taken possession of him. He reeled like a drunken man. Making a
      frantic effort to recover himself, he sank on the earth amid a clump of
      leaves and brush, that half hid him from observation. How long he lay in
      this stupor he could not tell, but when he became conscious of the
      dreadful <span class="pagenum">[094]</span><a name="link094" id="link094"></a>place
      he was in, he slowly struggled to his feet, half-dazed and bewildered. His
      first thought was to wonder where Bill was. He recollected that he had
      fled in hot haste with the others, and the last glimpse of him which he
      had, was when the plucky Massachusetts captain made his stand, but was
      compelled to surrender. He was sure that he had been wounded, for he saw
      blood streaming down Bill's face, as he ran.

    <p>
      &ldquo;Could he have escaped, or is he among the dead lying here?&rdquo; he thought.
      &ldquo;I must search for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And as he threaded his way among the dead and wounded as best he could in
      the twilight, he stumbled over the body of a boy. Kneeling down, he turned
      the lad's face upward, and in the dim light he knew him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is Charlie Arlington!&mdash;he is surely dead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy opened his eyes, and seeing Ralph, he assured him that he was not
      wounded, but he feared his ankle was sprained. &ldquo;I told you,&rdquo; he said, with
      a smile, &ldquo;that we should meet again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did, but I did not think it would be so soon. Are you injured?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only by my horse, who stumbled and threw me with such force against that
      old stump that I fainted with pain. Do you think my leg is broken?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me examine it. No, I don't think it is. How are you going to ride,
      however? Where is your horse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he ran away after serving me that mean trick. But why <span
      class="pagenum">[095]</span><a name="link095" id="link095"></a>are you
      here? Don't you know you are my prisoner now?&rdquo; he continued, smiling
      broadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How's that?&rdquo; Ralph spoke sharp and loud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; the other cautioned. &ldquo;You'll have a dozen soldiers after you.
      They're coming back to bury the dead. Of course you're my prisoner. You're
      on our field&mdash;were you not routed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This fact rather staggered Ralph. It had not come home to him till then;
      he looked anxiously toward the river's bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy divined his thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's no use to try to swim that stream here. The current's too strong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0072" id="linkimage-0072"> </a>

      href="images/8103.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </div>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems I'm your prisoner, then.&rdquo; Ralph's sad tones spoke volumes. The
      horrors of captivity stared him in the face. He thought at that instant,
      of his mother, sisters and the dear old home, and his heart was heavy as
      lead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charlie appeared to be enjoying the advantage he had over Ralph, for he
      never removed his gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've but to raise my voice and you'd be surrounded in an instant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how is it you are here now; I thought you knew nothing about the
      army,&rdquo; said Ralph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <span class="pagenum">[096]</span><a name="link096" id="link096"></a>didn't
      when I last saw you, but I joined the Southern army the next week. I am in
      the cavalry service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ralph's curiosity would never be silenced. &ldquo;Do you like it?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and no. I have been in several engagements, but the hardest blow I
      had was when they carried my father home dead, and I asked for a furlough,
      to go home to see him once more, and was refused.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the boy nearly broke down. Ralph's sympathies were aroused at once.
      He knew not what to say. But Charlie recovered himself soon, and continued&mdash;&ldquo;You
      see how I'm placed now. I shall <i>have</i> to take you into our camp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish Bill were here!&rdquo; Ralph blurted out. &ldquo;He wouldn't see me taken
      prisoner so easily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To him Bill represented the sum total of all knowledge, and he felt
      confident of his ability to rescue him, even in the face of the danger
      that now menaced him.
    </p>
    <p>
      A low whistle startled both boys. A few feet from them, stretched
      lengthwise of a fallen tree, lay Bill, who raised his head, which was
      bleeding freely.,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've a good mind to take you both prisoners!&rdquo; he said, jocosely. &ldquo;What
      are you exchanging courtesies for? The boy's right. Unless we can get away
      in a very big hurry, he can land us both in the rebel camp, and then it'll
      be all over with us. You'd better be planning each other's escape, and
      then you'll both be likely to be court-martialed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's my luck, isn't it? I can't blame Charlie if he does take me. But I
      haven't got anything against him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither has any of us got anything against any of the Johnnies. This is
      not a personal affair, at all. But just the same we've got to fight 'em
      because they're agin the government.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ralph looked closer at Bill. &ldquo;You're wounded, and will be carried to
      prison, too! Oh, Bill, what will become of you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">[097]</span><a name="link097" id="link097"></a>

    <p>
      &ldquo;It's nothing but a scratch. I lay here awhile till those fellows' <span
      class="pagenum">[098]</span><a name="link098" id="link098"></a>guns gave
      out, for I felt a little dizzy, and didn't care to get up till the smoke
      cleared away, and I could make out my bearings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A groan from their companion recalled them to their position. Ralph was in
      a fever of anxiety. War was a brutalizing affair, he pondered. &ldquo;You
      mustn't have any feelings at all, Bill, if you want to be a good soldier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nary a feeling. Humanity don't cut no figger in a battle. Why, boy, I've
      stood in the ranks and seen father on one side, and son on the other,
      blazing away with hate and bitterness in their eyes. And all on account of
      a mere difference of opinion.&rdquo; Ralph shuddered. &ldquo;It is dreadful; but war
      shall never make me so hardened and indifferent to suffering that I will
      not do all I can in honor to relieve it. I intend to fulfill all my duties
      as a soldier, but do not see why I should hesitate to show mercy to an
      injured foe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's the right sort,&rdquo; Bill chuckled to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      With that thought in his mind, Ralph went nearer to Charlie, and said&mdash;&ldquo;Give
      me your handkerchief, and I will bandage your ankle.&rdquo; In a few moments he
      had finished binding it on, tightly and skillfully, while the boy looked
      his gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It feels a little easier,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the pain was intense.&rdquo; Bill watched
      them both narrowly. In his heart he admired &ldquo;the little rebel cuss,&rdquo; but
      he wished him a thousand miles away, for he saw that it was impossible to
      make their escape, as Charlie had only to raise his voice as he had
      suggested, and the enemy would be upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a moment of anxiety for the man and his companion. Charlie was the
      most indifferent of the three. &ldquo;I'd rather have been killed than have to
      go to their prison, for who knows how long it may be before I am
      exchanged?&rdquo; thought Bill.

      The firing had ceased, and darkness had settled o'er the earth. Suddenly
      Charlie seemed to recollect something, for he whispered&mdash;&ldquo;Go&mdash;you
      must go, at once. The detail will soon be here, to bury our poor boys, and
      they will have you, sure. Go down the bluff as still as you can; don't
      loosen a pebble even, for there <span class="pagenum">[099]</span><a
      name="link099" id="link099"></a>are sharp ears near. Keep close to the
      river bank, and about half a mile down you'll see an old tree standing
      that has been struck by lightning. Two rods north of the tree a little
      skiff is hid in the tall weeds. Take it and row across. Go quick, and,
      above all, make no noise. My life, as well as yours, is in danger. They'd
      shoot me in a minute, if they knew I helped you escape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're a brick&mdash;you are!&rdquo; broke out Bill, admiringly. Ralph wrung
      his hand. &ldquo;What will you do? You can't lie here all night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They'll find me all right and carry me off to the hospital. I can talk,
      if I can't walk, and I'll soon let them know where I am. But you haven't a
      second to waste. Go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hint, so urgently given, was acted upon, and none too speedily, for a
      moment after, the men appeared, and Charlie was suddenly seized with a
      violent fit of coughing, so loud and boisterous, it was well calculated to
      cover any noise which Ralph and Bill might unintentionally make. He was
      placed on a litter and borne away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bill scarce drew a breath until his feet touched the bottom of the boat.
      Charlie's violent cough had served them well, for though they stole
      noiselessly down the bluff, the night was so still that a breath almost
      could be detected. They were soon across the noble river, and their hearts
      beat tumultuously when they found themselves safe within the Union lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bill's wound was not serious, so he declared. He even objected to the few
      days in the hospital which the surgeon prescribed. His good nature never
      left him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sick men may go and lay up, but you cain't kill Old Bill. I'm presarved
      for something better than to stop a bullet. I've been through too many
      hard sieges to give in for a little blow like that was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've got another invite to see the Colonel,&rdquo; a grizzled old soldier
      said to Ralph a day or two after the engagement. &ldquo;He desires the pleasure
      of your company in his tent. Leastwise, that's what it amounts to, though
      that ain't the language he <span class="pagenum">[100]</span><a
      name="link100" id="link100"></a>made use of. Wonder why I don't be asked
      once in awhile? He don't know what he's losing by not consulting me. But
      hurry up&mdash;'tain't perlite to keep him waiting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ralph trembled visibly, and every drop of blood turned to ice. He knew
      something must be wrong. Perhaps he ought not to have helped Charlie, but
      what else could he do? He walked briskly toward the tent of the officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Hopkins was a stern, battle-scarred old soldier, who wasted no
      words. His keen vision could discover merit, however, and as he looked
      steadily at Ralph, he took his measure at once.

      &ldquo;Why should I not? I am a soldier, sir!&rdquo; and the boy's &ldquo;I will, with the

      One of the most brilliant affaire of the war was the charge of a body of
      cavalry under Fremont. This was a fine and choice <span class="pagenum">[102]</span><a

      Guard,&rdquo; whose exploits were famous. It was commanded by Major Charles

      This dashing and fiery soldier, with a band of 160 men, charged upon a
      Confederate force of 2,000, who were drawn up in a hollow square. He rode
      across the field, unheeding the firing of the skirmishers, but charged
      into the midst of the Confederates, and with pistols and sabers, scattered
      them like dry leaves in the autumn wind. Not content with this, the daring
      Major chased them into the streets of Springfield, and fought them hand to
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this daring and unequaled achievement, he hoisted the National flag
      upon the courthouse at Springfield, sent a guard to care for the wounded,
      and then went quietly back to Bolivar.

      INTER so <span class="pagenum">[103]</span><a name="link103" id="link103"></a>far
      had brought them much suffering and privation. To Ralph it was peculiarly
      dreary. With the prospect of a period of inactivity, it was strange that
      so little provision was made to protect them from the cold, raw winds that
      were so frequent. Many of the soldiers put up rude huts, made from the
      fine timber which grew so plentiful in that region, and those who were
      independent and enterprising enough to build for themselves, often
      fashioned a very snug, cozy little house. The rough stone fireplace, put
      together with Virginia mud, was never wanting. What though it was neither
      symmetrical nor artistic? The warmth and cheer compensated for the absence
      of both these features.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some of these huts&mdash;they surely deserved a better title&mdash;the
      men threw themselves down at night on the ground, which was covered with
      blankets, rubber coats, and any material the jovial occupants could find
      to keep out the dampness. Some, more pretentious, constructed bunks or
      boxes round the sides, which were as comfortable as a spring bed would be
      at home. It was quite common to find home-made chairs, benches and tables,
      round which they gathered when off duty, and told stories or discussed the
      situation. The walls were papered with illustrations cut from newspapers,
      which added to the charms of the dwelling.

      But the greater number shivered under canvas tents, feeling keenly the
      light snows and rains, followed by days of thaw and sunshine, which were
      so frequent. To add to the dreariness of their surroundings, the funeral
      dirge was often heard, as the dead were carried out from hospital, who had
      succumbed to that apparently <span class="pagenum">[105]</span><a
      name="link105" id="link105"></a>simple disease, the measles, but which
      leaves its victim feeble, exhausted, and unable to rally.
    </p>
    <p>
      To a new recruit, or to one who is full of sensibility, as Ralph was,
      these sights were particularly depressing.

      A snowstorm during the day had been succeeded by a windy, cold night.
      Ralph had been writing to his mother, and while he took care to make every
      word as cheerful as he could, and never to mention his discomforts, vet
      the mother heart between the lines, and knew her boy was homesick, pining
      for her, as she, alas! was longing for the loving caress and the sound of
      his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he pushed back the stool which had answered for a writing desk, the
      wind gave a sudden whirl and lifted the canvas, sending a shower of sleet
      over him which made him shiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The winter here is full as cold and disagreeable as up North!&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;I thought this was a land of perpetual sunshine and flowers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He <span class="pagenum">[106]</span><a name="link106" id="link106"></a>peered
      out at the sentry, who hugged his great coat closer, as he paced to and
      fro. He fancied he saw in the gloom a man and horse, and heard the sharp
      challenge&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Halt! Who goes there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The horseman drew up, and replied promptly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A messenger from General Shields, with dispatches for Colonel Hopkins. I
      must deliver them at once.&rdquo;

      message from headquarters!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words were passed along the line of guards, until it reached the
      sergeant, who came instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He carried the papers to his colonel, who read them hastily, and signed
      each one, handing them back to the orderly, who rode swiftly away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ralph was by this time outside his tent, unmindful of the sleet <span
      class="pagenum">[107]</span><a name="link107" id="link107"></a>which tore
      his flesh like sharp-pointed arrows. He longed to know what those
      dispatches signified, but his curiosity had to remain unsatisfied, and he
      went back to his tent to try to sleep, as well as he could, for the biting
      wind that forced its way into every crevice.

      He seated himself on the side of his bed, and tried to think. He wondered
      when General McClellan was going to take Richmond. The cry &ldquo;All Quiet on
      the Potomac&rdquo; was heard continually, and weary men and weeping women all
      over the land were longing for the dawn of peace which should bring back
      to them fathers, husbands and sons. But ah, that peace was far distant.
      The boy reasoned that he had no right to criticise the men who held
      trusted positions in the army. But surely the boys in camp and field were
      doing all they could, under orders, to hasten the end of these troublous
      times. Would the conflict ever cease?
    </p>
    <p>
      Perplexed <span class="pagenum">[108]</span><a name="link108" id="link108"></a>and
      worn out in trying to solve the problem agitating so many of the most
      patriotic and the most far-seeing, all over the land, Ralph at last fell
      asleep, to be roused by the reveille. He sprang up, sure that he must be
      dreaming, for he had just been sleeping but a moment&mdash;a mere &ldquo;cat
      nap,&rdquo; and this couldn't be a summons to leave his comfortable bed. He had
      neither time nor right to object, however; his sole duty was to obey
      orders, and he hastened to dress. Outside, the soldiers were hurrying
      about, most of those who were called on glad of any break in the monotony
      of their first winter in camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Breakfast at two, march at half-past,&rdquo; was the captain's peremptory
      order.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an unearthly hour,&rdquo; was Ralph's comment. &ldquo;Where, are we bound? And
      why march at night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't say,&rdquo; a comrade ventured, &ldquo;unless it's so we won't have to march by
      day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were not long in suspense.
    </p>
    <p>
      A portion of their regiment was ordered to assist a force of Ohio and
      Indiana men under Colonel Dunning, in routing a body of Confederates who
      were posted near Romney, Va., at a point called Blue Gap.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wind had died away, the stars were out, and the moon shone
      brilliantly. The cutting sleet had turned to snow, and the soft carpet lay
      white and pure, muffling the sound of their footsteps. It was a weird
      sight&mdash;that mass of men tramping along with steady steps, while their
      shadows falling on the ground danced and flickered in the moonbeams with
      startling vividness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blue Gap was a natural opening between hills, and was well defended by
      howitzers and rifle pits. As they approached the Gap, Ralph's keen eye
      detected a dozen men piling up limbs, straw, and other inflammable
      material, against the bridge that spanned a stream running through the
      Gap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;some of those fellows have left the lines, and are
      fixing things nice to burn that bridge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll block that game, instanter. We need that bridge more than they do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A <span class="pagenum">[109]</span><a name="link109" id="link109"></a>dash
      was made for the bridge, led by the captain, who opened fire upon them,
      and thus ended that attempt. On the hills the entrenchments were held
      manfully, but the Confederates had scarce time to pour forth their fire,
      before the two Ohio regiments dashed upon them, and captured two pieces of
      artillery. The surprise was so complete and the attack so overwhelming,
      that defense was vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hills were swarming with Federals, fighting hand to hand, and forcing
      their opponents back. The houses on the other shore were filled with
      sharpshooters, whose constant firing harassed the Federals, and brought
      down a soldier at nearly every shot.
    </p>
    <p>
      A score of men sprang into a large boat lying at the bank, and with a
      storm of bullets hissing and rattling about them, they crossed to the
      shore where the sharpshooters were hidden. Death menaced them, but with a
      huzza that would have put life into a stone, they rowed fast, and sprang
      out of the boat. Dashing up the hill, to the houses which the enemy had
      used for vantage ground, they found them vacated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They didn't wait to make our acquaintance,&rdquo; Ralph said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but those sharpshooters introduced themselves to us in fine style.
      Why, a man went down at nearly every shot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bill said not a word, but leaned heavily over the side of the boat. No one
      paid him attention, for their hearts were filled with a longing for
      revenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys, we have missed the rebs ensconced in these houses, but we can
      prevent their using them again. We will burn them to the ground, and take
      good care that not a timber stands, after we have done with them. They
      have picked off some of our best men, and we won't leave a roof to shelter
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A dozen pairs of willing hands were at work in an instant gathering wood
      and brush, which they piled around the dwellings. With faces grimy and
      soiled, these resolute men touched the pile with a match, while they stood
      ready to shoot the first man who dared to show himself to protest, and
      soon the flames leaped upward, crackling, sputtering and curling round
      doors no and <span class="pagenum">[110]</span><a name="link110"      id="link110"></a>windows, licking up every object within reach, till
      naught but the charred and blackened timbers stood to mark the spot where
      the sharpshooters had dealt their deadly work.
    </p>
    <p>
      The skirmish was brief. It was an easy victory, and no loss had been
      sustained by the Federals, save those who were shot in the boats. But the
      Confederate loss was greater. Forty soldiers were lying dead in the grass
      and weeds, and as many more were carried back to camp, prisoners.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even while the houses were being consumed, Ralph went back to assist those
      who had received the bullets of the sharpshooters. Some had fallen
      overboard, and sunk in the stream. Others were lying as they had fallen,
      their cold hands still grasping their weapons, which they would never use
      again. One poor fellow was kneeling in the bottom of the boat, his finger
      on the trigger of his musket, and his staring eyes fixed on the shore.
      Ralph shuddered. Could he ever become inured to these dreadful sights?
    </p>
    <p>
      Bill Elliott was leaning over the side of the boat, in a half-stupor. The
      wound in his head had opened afresh, and the red stream was running down
      his face, staining its ghastly whiteness crimson. His arm hung useless by
      his side, shattered by a bullet. Opening his eyes at the sound of Ralph's
      voice, he whispered faintly: &ldquo;I thought you'd come arter me. They've fixed
      me this time, sure,&rdquo; and he relapsed into unconsciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      A litter was soon hurried together, and Old Bill was placed in hospital.

      HE Johnnies <span class="pagenum">[111]</span><a name="link111"      id="link111"></a>are busy these times, aren't they?' &ldquo;And so are we,
      chasing them up. I don't see that we are any nearer Richmond than we were
      a month or so ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor we won't be,&rdquo; broke in another man, &ldquo;if General McClellan repeats his
      Yorktown tactics. Perhaps, by the time we get to Richmond, we'll find some
      'Quaker guns' there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must have been kind of disheartening to the boys after lying 'round a
      place a month to have the rebs move out just as they were getting ready to
      go in, and find they had left a lot of wooden guns behind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All the next day the soldiers were working on the redoubts, and wholly
      unaware of the surprise in store for them. May 31st dawned, and while they
      were still fortifying their position, a tremor ran through the line. &ldquo;The
      Confederates are upon us!&rdquo; was the cry, and as they tossed aside the
      shovels, the Confederates charged upon them with their well-known &ldquo;yell&rdquo;
       that so often echoed and re-echoed on the battle-field.
    </p>
    <p>
      But they found brave men ready to repel their assault. The Chickahominy
      had swollen to such a height that bridges were carried away in its mad
      rush. General McClellan had thrown the left wing of his forces across the
      stream, but it was impossible to get reinforcements to their help.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both sides showed unexampled bravery. General Johnston moved on toward
      Richmond, six miles away, where he halted, for the purpose of striking the
      detached wing of the Union forces. The rise of the river had hampered the
      movements of the latter, and it seemed as if capture was certain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The half-finished redoubts had been occupied by General Casey's <span
      class="pagenum">[112]</span><a name="link112" id="link112"></a>division of
      Keys' corps, and although they rallied several times, it was in vain. The
      rebels, made a detour, and stole upon their rear, and they could no longer
      hold them. Their line was in danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile General Johnston's evident intention was to bring up a heavy
      flanking force between General Casey and the river whose banks had risen
      so unluckily for the Federals, cutting off all hopes of reinforcements.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now a magnificent exhibition of courage was shown by Sumner. He
      expected orders to go to the rescue, and his men were drawn up in line
      ready for the summons. One bridge alone remained with which to cross the
      river, and its approaches were under water. Some of its supports were
      gone, and as the soldiers stepped upon it, the frail structure swayed to
      and fro, mid the rushing waters, but they passed over as speedily and
      safely as though it were a solid piece of masonry.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Sumner's appearance was most opportune. He met the flank attack,
      and was victorious. The slaughter was fearful. In this battle 12,000 men
      gave up their lives&mdash;5,000 Northern men, and 7,000 Southern.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Johnston fell, a Federal shot having taken effect. He was carried
      off the field, and at first it was feared by the Confederates that his
      wound was mortal, but after some months of suffering and enforced
      retirement he recovered, and a year after assumed command of the
      Confederate forces of the Mississippi.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ralph was sent with one of the details to bury the dead and bring in the
      wounded. Trenches were dug, and the dead piled in them. Many were left
      where the last shot had struck them down, and earth was heaped upon them.
      The ground was literally blood-soaked. The dead were everywhere&mdash;the
      battle-field was one vast graveyard, with its tenants left unburied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ralph entered a little log house in a pasture near the railroad, and
      seated himself on a bench for a moment's rest. Just outside the door, he
      found the dead and the wounded packed so close that he could scarcely
      avoid stepping on them. To distinguish <span class="pagenum">[113]</span><a
      name="link113" id="link113"></a>them was a hard task, for the wounded lay
      there so quiet and motionless, fast in that silent resignation born of
      despair, that, save for the dull blackness that covered the faces of those
      from whom life had fled, it would be easy to mistake the living for the
      dead.

    <p>
      All sorts and ages were there, in one mass&mdash;the boy, who had gone
      from home, ardent and hopeful, the old man who had left the record of an
      honorable life behind him; officers who had cheered their commands on to
      victory, privates who had fought fearlessly&mdash;all lay there, while
      horses had fallen dead across their riders, or were struggling in agony.
      The picture was horrible! He was r e minded of h is duty by the voice of
      an old man, who came into the room where he was musing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a cruel war, sir!&rdquo; he said to Ralph. &ldquo;I've been raised here, man
      and boy, nigh onto seventy years, and I never thought, when I played in
      these fields, that I should ever live to see them desecrated with human
      blood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ralph <span class="pagenum">[114]</span><a name="link114" id="link114"></a>raised
      his head, and looked at him earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; the old man continued, &ldquo;I have looked for the coming of the Lord'
      these many years, but I never thought He would come in blood and smoke,
      and the noise of battle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; the boy asked, breathlessly. &ldquo;How has the Lord come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has He not come to set human beings free? Is not the black man's bondage
      nearly over? Is not slavery doomed? Then the only blot upon the fair name
      of America will be wiped out. The North and South will become brothers
      again, and go hand in hand in all worthy undertakings. Thus, as one family
      again, they will march on, to a grand and glorious destiny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If my mother could hear him talk!&rdquo; his listener thought. &ldquo;What does he
      mean by the blacks being set free?&rdquo; For the Proclamation of Emancipation
      had not yet been given to the world, and the position of the slaves during
      hostilities had not been settled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you a Northerner?&rdquo; he asked the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I am a Southerner,&rdquo; with a tinge of pride in his tones. &ldquo;How do you
      dare say such things?&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am an old man, and they call me childish and silly. But I love my
      country, and I want to see her truly great.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you always talked in this way?&rdquo; queried Ralph, puzzled at the old
      man's language and manners.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always. Oh, I have paid dearly for my opinions. I have had my house torn
      down over my head, I have suffered in my young days; but I have lost all I
      ever loved, and they pity me now. I know I shall live to see my prayer
      answered&mdash;that we may become a free and united country. Then I shall
      be ready to die. Yes, it comes to that with old and young. We must all be
      ready to die at any moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a courteous nod to Ralph, he passed out of the door, and the boy was
      left alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must be ready to die at any moment!&rdquo; The words sounded like a knell to
      Ralph. Was <i>he</i> ready to die? He had, been carefully nurtured by that
      blessing to a child, a praying mother, <span class="pagenum">[115]</span><a
      name="link115" id="link115"></a>and his boyish days were spent in the
      Sabbath school. Like all in the springtime of life, death seemed afar off,
      something that would not approach him for many years. Death was the
      expected portion of the old, but he had always resolutely put aside all
      thoughts of a future that did not belong to this life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now these words came home like a shock. Was he ready? He had never been a
      bad boy, in any sense, but still he was not ready or willing to die. At
      that possibility his courage forsook him; memory went swiftly back to many
      a childish piece of wrong-doing, which, under the fear of death, he
      magnified into black and unpardonable sins. Filled with sorrow and
      repentance he fell on his knees on the hard floor of that little cabin,
      with the dead so near him, and cried&mdash;&ldquo;Help, O Lord, or I perish!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A wave of tender feeling swept over his soul, and his mother's favorite
      psalm, the 118th which she had read to him so often, came to his
      remembrance, and one verse was as music to him,&mdash;&ldquo;The Lord is on my
      side; I will not fear. What can man do unto me?&rdquo; He rose to his feet,
      refreshed and made strong.

    <p>
      HAT time <span class="pagenum">[116]</span><a name="link116" id="link116"></a>should
      not hang heavy on their hands, much inventive genius was brought into
      play, and no schoolboys, famous for their ability in making up games,
      could equal these grown men in originating sports to fill in the hours
      that otherwise would have been exceedingly dull. Some such safety-valve
      was necessary, or else many would have broken down with memories of the
      dear ones at home, and the depressing sights of war, and its hardships.
    </p>
    <p>
      The camp echoed often with the songs so dear to all who can be moved by
      tender thoughts. Many of the men were the possessors of rich, melodious
      voices, that brought many a thrill of delight to their listeners, in their
      tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ralph had a fine voice, and to please his comrades he often sang the sweet
      old songs of childhood, while they listened with an enthusiasm and rounds
      of applause that many a prima donna could not have inspired. Throwing
      themselves around the blazing camp fire whose ruddy sparks flew
      heavenward, the whole company would join him in singing the melodies with
      hearty goodwill, and at those moments care and danger were forgotten. Now
      he would give them a plaintive, gentle ditty that would make the eyes of
      those brown-faced soldiers moist with emotion, as home pictures started
      into life before them, and then a stirring song of patriotism and victory
      would ring out, until the blood would leap in their veins, and each man
      there was ready to attack any foe single-handed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the boy's heart was heavy, even while his humble efforts in the
      musical line were giving pleasure to his comrades. His constant prayer was
      that some decisive move might be made, by which the war might be brought
      to a speedy close. He <span class="pagenum">[117]</span><a name="link117"      id="link117"></a>was lonely, too, for &ldquo;Old Bill,&rdquo; as he always called
      himself, had been in the hospital for some time, and he missed his cheery
      ways.

    <p>
      One afternoon as he sat in his tent reading, he heard peals of boisterous
      laughter ringing out upon the air. Going to the opening, he saw a group of
      soldiers gathered round some object, and heard them chaffing some one whom
      he could not see.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the excitement, Harry?&rdquo; he asked a companion who had evidently
      come from the scene of action.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I just came for you to pile out and see the fun. They've got <span
      class="pagenum">[118]</span><a name="link118" id="link118"></a>one of our
      boys, and are amusing themselves at his expense. Come on, or you'll be too
      late. The performance will be over.&rdquo; Ralph hurried after Harry, who was
      off like a deer, and going straight up to the group, he saw a crowd of men
      tossing another one up in the air, and letting him fall into a blanket,
      amid screams of laughter, and cries of &ldquo;Send him up higher!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pickle him in his own salt!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Head him up in a barrel, and send him to the cook!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll make a high private in the rear rank of him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gently, boys,&rdquo; the victim panted. &ldquo;You don't want to be too hard on a
      poor fellow for having a little joke of his own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is it&mdash;what has he done?&rdquo; inquired Ralph, who didn't enjoy such
      rough sport, and was really concerned lest they might carry it so far as
      to injure the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's Corporal Fred Greene, the funny fellow of Co. H,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tim Mackey responded. &ldquo;It's his birthday, and we re celebrating it. And
      he's having a high time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fred was a mischievous young fellow, who had just seen his twenty-third
      birthday. If there was any chance for a joke on any member of the company,
      he never lost the opportunity of making the most he could out of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to impress the fact that he had a birthday, he had invited a
      score of his comrades to a &ldquo;small spread&rdquo; in his tent. The colored cook
      was in the secret, and through his connivance, and the help of a few
      cracker boxes draped with bunting, and some tin cans, he had succeeded in
      making quite a tasty looking table. Before the banquet began, he made a
      short speech of welcome, which was responded to in good faith by Franklin
      Field, who was deputed to do the speaking on all occasions, as he had
      quite a gift of extempore oratory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without further ceremony, Fred cordially pressed all of them to &ldquo;fall to.&rdquo;
       Just at this interesting moment, the cook, a loose-jointed, wrinkled old
      darkey, whose huge mouth looked as if it was always ready to utter a
      guffaw, entered the tent, and scraping and bowing to the &ldquo;gemmens,&rdquo; broke
      out with&mdash;&ldquo;Sorry to put back your 'joyment, Massa Fred, but youse
      wanted outside, bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fred <span class="pagenum">[119]</span><a name="link119" id="link119"></a>rose,
      and with a graceful salute to his guests, begged them, in a most elaborate
      manner, to attack the food, which was entirely at their service. It was
      unfortunate that he should be disturbed at such a moment, but duty called
      him, and he would return at the earliest opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This black rascal is bound I shan't have my share, but fall to, friends.&rdquo;
       Once outside, he hunted a safe hiding place waited behind a hedge.
    </p>

      Those left behind sat a moment lost in wonder as to where the good things
      sprang from. They did look inviting to these devourers of hard tack and
      bacon. The table had for a centerpiece a fine-looking chicken, flanked on
      both wings by oranges, potatoes roasted in the ashes, canned fruit, and&mdash;two
      huge cakes!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did Fred get these dainties? He's too lazy to forage, and I don't
      believe he could buy them at the sutler's tent. His <span class="pagenum">[120]</span><a
      name="link120" id="link120"></a>credit, ain't good enough,&rdquo; was the
      comment made by one of his &ldquo;friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind where he got 'em,&rdquo; a gaunt, hungry-looking fellow answered.
      &ldquo;Let's try 'em fust, and investigate afterwards.&rdquo; No further urging was
      necessary. They all &ldquo;fell to,&rdquo; as they had been ordered, but the wry
      faces, choking, gasping breath, and muttered expletives, as one after
      another bit into some tempting morsel to find a mouth filled with salt,
      pepper or sand, would have been a subject for a painter. The chicken was a
      sham; its unusual plumpness was due to a liberal stuffing of cotton
      batting, the oranges were well sanded, while the cake was plentifully
      seasoned with salt and pepper&mdash;two condiments that are very well in
      proper proportions, but rather nauseating when taken in large doses.
    </p>
    <p>
      They rose in a body&mdash;all were of one mind when they rushed out after
      their host, who was making for the woods at the other end of camp. A dozen
      fleet-footed men soon overtook him, and, bringing him back, proceeded to
      inflict summary punishment, amid roars of laughter, for he was liked by
      every man of the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fred didn't play any more jokes upon those boys, and after his undesired
      elevation, he was quite subdued. But they all forgave him, and &ldquo;Fred's
      birthday party&rdquo; passed into a byword, when some illustration was needed to
      indicate a good time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ralph was homesick. It was useless to disguise the fact, for it began to
      tell upon his health. Malaria had fastened its strong hand upon him, and
      he grew more listless every day. He did not waver in his duties, however,
      and when marching orders came, he was among the first to pack his knapsack
      and shoulder his musket.

      HE summer <span class="pagenum">[122]</span><a name="link122" id="link122"></a>of
      1862 was hot and dry. Streams were parched, the grass was brown and
      burned. The army trailed through the dust, and lay down at night footsore,
      weary and sick. Often the only water they had to drink was supplied by
      &ldquo;brackish&rdquo; ponds, whose surface was covered with greenish slime. Fevers
      and malaria broke out among the regiments, and dissatisfaction was loud
      and outspoken. Now and then a brush would take place, or a skirmishing
      party would sally out, surprise a party of Confederates, bringing some of
      them into camp prisoners.

      &ldquo;Knapsacks and rations ready by seven in the morning!&rdquo; Fred Greene said,
      one September afternoon as they were watching eagerly and impatiently for
      some move to be made. .
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure its not another of your jokes, corporal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No joke this time, as you'll find to your sorrow, perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many days' rations are we to carry along?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't say. We're going out to interview General Lee. His victory at
      Manassas the other day has given him the idea that he can bring the whole
      State of Maryland into his army. He's traveling in that direction. He has
      a poster out inviting the Marylanders to enlist, but by all we hear, it
      won't bring many valuable accessions to his ranks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For two reasons. If they want to enlist, they'll do so, without his
      starting recruiting offices. Most of the able-bodied men who wanted to go
      to war did so long since. Then again, most of the Marylanders are fond of
      the old flag. The State has never left the Union. General Lee is a fine
      military man, but he <span class="pagenum">[123]</span><a name="link123"      id="link123"></a>surely don't understand the people he's trying to
      interest. Hallo! what's a woman doing here? She's coming this way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A woman, dressed in cheap, but neat and tidy-looking clothing, and holding
      the hands of two sad-eyed, poorly attired children, was making her way
      toward them. A soldier stepped up to her, and with a pleasant smile asked
      her if she was looking for any one.
    </p>

    <p>
      The woman looked earnestly into his face, as she said&mdash;&ldquo;You'uns all
      look kind. Can you show me whar to find Peter Hall?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man looked puzzled, and uncertain as to how to answer her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't know him, ma'am. What regiment is he in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't tell you, sir. He is my man, and he 'lowed he wouldn't go against
      the old flag, for any one. The neighbors said he was a traitor to the
      cause, and wouldn't give him any work. So he went off in the night, and
      told me he'd make his way into the Union army, and as soon as he could
      he'd send me word whar he was. He 'lowed I could take care of the babies
      somehow, but I've found it mighty hard work to get bread for 'em often.
      They're good children, though, no better nowhar, and they don't complain,
      not even when they're hungry. I heard you'uns were in the neighborhood,
      and I thought as perhaps you'd know whar my Peter is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys!&rdquo; the soldier cried to a group who were listening at a little
      distance. &ldquo;Do any of you know Pete Hall?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Peter</i> Hall,&rdquo; the woman corrected, with great dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse <span class="pagenum">[124]</span><a name="link124" id="link124"></a>me,
      ma'am; <i>Peter</i> Hall, I meant to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, certain, I know him,&rdquo; a man answered. &ldquo;He's in the Second Maryland,
      and they're over there, on the brow of that hill. Go right over, ma'am.
      You'll find him, I hope,&rdquo; he added in a lower tone. &ldquo;Don't be afraid. No
      one will harm you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me and the children have walked twelve miles since yesterday noon, and we
      want to see Peter bad. He'd have come out and met us, I know he would, if
      he'd have thought we were so near,&rdquo; she added, with refreshing simplicity.
      The idea of Peter's leaving his company, even for so important a matter as
      meeting her, caused a general laugh, which she did not seem to observe,
      but continued&mdash;&ldquo;You see, we have moved since Peter went away, and he
      doesn't know where we live now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless the woman and her Peter,&rdquo; was the honest invocation sent after
      her, as she hurried away in the direction pointed out, and they were
      rewarded a few moments later, by seeing a soldier spring up from the grass
      where he had been lounging, and hasten forward to receive the greeting of
      his wife, who sobbed for joy upon his breast, while the little ones could
      only jump and shout in the fullness of their pleasure at seeing &ldquo;Pa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Many a man stood there, and silently wished some of their loved ones could
      meet and greet them also.
    </p>
    <p>
      The entrance of the boys in blue into Frederick was a perfect ovation.
      General Lee had retired from the town only two days before.
    </p>
    <p>
      This welcome thrilled their hearts. From every door and window the
      national flag fluttered, and the stores were decorated with the colors.
      Banners were strung across the streets, from house to house, while crowds
      of happy men and women with radiant faces, spoke words of welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Good luck seemed to be showered upon them, for General McClellan here
      captured a copy of the orders of General Lee, which gave him a key to the
      whole situation. It was of very recent date, and the Confederate commander
      had mapped out his campaign. The <span class="pagenum">[125]</span><a
      name="link125" id="link125"></a>information contained in these explicit
      instructions to his generals, enabled General McClellan to see plainly how
      to thwart General Lee. So he proceeded to send two corps through the two
      Gaps of South Mountain, with the prospect of being able to cut the enemy's
      forces to pieces.
    </p>

    <p>
      Dividing his command, General McClellan ordered Franklin to Crampton's
      Gap, while Reno and Hooker, with Burnside at their head, were sent to
      Turner's Gap.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a toilsome task for even those sturdy men to ascend the sides of
      the Gaps. South Mountain towered a thousand feet above them, while the
      most accessible points were the two Gaps, each nearly 400 feet high.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We've got to reach the top of those hills somehow,&rdquo; Ralph said. &ldquo;But it's
      one step forward, and three backward. Our men are gaining a little. They
      show splendid pluck.&rdquo; Clambering, toiling up the rocky hillsides, the
      Union forces made their painful way. From behind ledges and trees, the
      rebel riflemen marked their slow progress, and sent many a man to his
      death. The company to which Ralph belonged was under Reno, and assaulted
      the southern crest of Turner's Gap. On the northern crest of the mountain
      General Hooker, with splendid courage, kept on.

    <p>
      Ralph now realized how desperately men will fight. He even felt that hot
      hatred which two foes ever feel, when pitted against each other. He saw
      the Federal army, scratched and bruised from forcing their way through the
      brush and over rocks, while the Confederate riflemen poured bullets into
      their midst like <span class="pagenum">[127]</span><a name="link127"      id="link127"></a>rain. Hot, and panting with their efforts, still they
      never wavered. Gibbon, with his brigade, was trying to force a passage
      through the turnpike in the Gap, and here also the enemy did terrible
      execution. The heat was blistering. The fervid rays of the September sun
      burned into their very blood, and the dust which rose in clouds mixed with
      the smoke of the powder, and choked and blinded them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0095" id="linkimage-0095"> </a>
    </p>

    <p>
      They had fought continuously the entire day. Their canteens were empty&mdash;their
      mouths parched and dry. Ralph saw a tall officer spur his horse forward,
      and fire at General Reno. That gallant soldier reeled in his saddle, and
      fell, but as he was borne to the rear to die, his eyes were fixed on the
      men he had so gallantly led, with a last look of farewell.
    </p>
    <p>
      This contest was long. Each side fought to the death. As Ralph turned to
      speak to a companion he heard a wild shout: &ldquo;Forward! One more such
      charge, and we'll have the Gap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the colonel's voice, and as he rose in his saddle and cheered them
      on, they took fresh courage. Wild responses answered his appeal, and new
      strength was given them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are sure of victory,&rdquo; Ralph said to himself, At that instant a horse
      dashed madly by. He bore General Garland, of the Confederate force, who
      was lying half across his back, as he was vainly striving to raise himself
      in the saddle. His hat rolled down the hill as he came to the ground with
      a shock; his fine features were distorted with pain, and his long, dark
      hair was dabbled with blood. He made one frantic effort to recover <span
      class="pagenum">[128]</span><a name="link128" id="link128"></a>his sword,
      which had slid from his grasp, and then he sank half on his knees, a livid
      corpse. Ralph was so near he could almost have touched him, and to his
      dying day, he never forgot the look of agony on the wan face, as the eyes
      fast glazed in death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Darkness settled down upon the earth, before the battle was won, by the
      Confederates withdrawing and leaving the Union forces masters of the
      field. But what a sacrifice of human life!&mdash;three thousand human
      beings sent into eternity, as the result of one day's conflict.
    </p>
    <p>
      The loss of life was felt equally by the two opposing forces; but the boys
      in gray suffered a loss of fifteen hundred, who were taken prisoners.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night was warm. The stars looked down with kindly gleams upon
      thousands of worn-out soldiers sleeping as quietly as little children,
      while the wounded were groaning with pain, as the life-blood slowly
      trickled over the grass which the hot sun and the trampling of feet and
      stamping of horses had matted into a tangled and brown mass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ralph's captain threw himself down by the side of the boy, as he was
      trying to shut out the dreadful pictures which were burned upon his brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the victory ours?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is, and a dear one to us,&rdquo; the captain replied. &ldquo;We have left over a
      thousand dead upon the field; but the Johnnies have moved off, and we have
      orders to push on to the western side of the mountain. They raked us down
      in terrible fashion, but the men stood their fire like statues. There was
      some heavy firing over at the other Gap a while back, but it has stopped
      now. Hallo!&rdquo; he called to a man in the uniform of an officer, &ldquo;where are
      you going in such a hurry? Has anything happened&mdash;any new move
      ahead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man stopped suddenly, and coming up close to them, with features
      convulsed and pallid, with either pain or fear, he made answer:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, captain, I'm sure I'll die, I'm in such misery. I'm all doubled <span
      class="pagenum">[129]</span><a name="link129" id="link129"></a>up, and
      can't sleep. I'm in perfect agony. There&mdash;there goes that twinge
      again. I must try and find my regiment, and hunt up the doctor right
      away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ralph looked incredulous at the man's apparent suffering. He felt sure it
      was a pretense. &ldquo;It's strange that he's so far away from his command, and
      going in an exactly opposite direction. Can it be that he's going to
      skip?&rdquo; This was a painful thought, and brought an angry flush to his brow,
      for he held nothing in such scorn, amounting to abhorrence, as he did
      cowardice or dishonesty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going in the right direction to join your company? If you keep on
      the way you are faced, you'll be more than likely to find some friendly
      boy in gray to snap you up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The officer looked steadily at him a moment, while his face turned
      scarlet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your advice is not required, sir. I shall remember your incivility at a
      more fitting time.&rdquo; And he stalked away, quite oblivious of the anguish
      that had racked him so short a time before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That fellow must be a mind-reader,&rdquo; laughed the captain. &ldquo;He plainly knew
      what you thought about him. But seriously, your opinion was rather harsh;
      he's probably shamming to get excused from duty. For the honor of our
      cause I should hope no officer would be guilty of such dastardly conduct.
      Nor a private, either,&rdquo; he added, a moment after, &ldquo;for the boys who carry
      the muskets have true grit, and don't run, only after the enemy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that's so, but when I saw him making such haste to get away, the
      suspicion would come into my mind. To me it seems a shame for a man with a
      spark of cowardice to wear a uniform.&rdquo;

    <p>
      ALPH arose <span class="pagenum">[130]</span><a name="link130" id="link130"></a>from
      the heap of leaves and brush which had served him for a bed the night
      through, with his bones aching and sore. The army was already stirring,
      for although the Passes were won, there was promise of another engagement
      at once. Word was passed along the line that General Lee had withdrawn his
      forces and crossed the Antietam, where he took up his position on a high
      bluff near Sharpsburg, and was thus able to command a view of the whole
      country. But he had met with great losses, from the dead in battle, and
      from stragglers. He realized the injury the latter had done him; indeed,
      he complained openly and bitterly, saying that his army was &ldquo;ruined by
      straggling.&rdquo; But the best men of his army were still left with him&mdash;picked
      men, of splendid courage and vast endurance. He was determined that the
      coming battle should decide the campaign, and he waited calmly its issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lee has the choice of positions,&rdquo; the men said. &ldquo;He has both flanks
      resting on the streams. He has the whole four bridges across the creek
      well guarded; that is, all but one, and that's the point we have to take.
      We intend to call the attention of the Johnnies to our point of attack,
      and throw our entire strength against the bridge that is left unguarded,
      and then cross. They say Lee hasn't much over 40,000 men, but they are a
      body we shall be proud to meet, and whip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The artillery practice on both sides was sharp all day, but not much
      execution was done. At nearly five in the afternoon General Hookers corps
      made, a dash across the upper bridge, and advancing through the woods,
      fell upon General Hoods brigade, and a fierce skirmish followed, but the
      darkness brought it to <span class="pagenum">[131]</span><a name="link131"      id="link131"></a>a close for that night, and both armies rested, eager for
      the morning light, that they might rush at each other again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before sunrise General McClellan hurried Mansfield's corps to Hookers aid,
      while Sumner was ready to follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The renewal of hostilities began early. As the sun rose, his beams lighted
      up the two armies, angry and threatening. General Hooker threw his forces
      with vigor against General Jackson's, and pressed him so hard he fell
      back. The batteries came promptly to the front, and raked the Confederates
      with shot the entire length of their line, breaking their ranks in wild
      haste.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crowding and forcing them back, General Mansfield came to the Unionists'
      aid, when a shot struck him, and he fell dead, but his command kept on,
      and entering the woods, got their position and held it, against immense
      odds. General Hooker here received a serious wound, and was carried away,
      just as General Sumner crossed the stream, drove the boys in gray before
      him, and entrenched his men near the little church of Dunker. Here the
      fighting raged so madly, and the artillery fire was so heavy, that a
      historian relates that years after, when the trees were cut down and sent
      to a sawmill to be made into logs, the saws were torn to pieces by the
      quantity of metal that had pierced the trees, and been hidden there by the
      growth of the wood. But in spite of this vigorous fire, no irresolution
      was shown, and as fast as men were shot down at the guns, others were
      ready to take their places, with undismayed zeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      A lull occurred, and as the sounds of firing seemed to die away, there was
      great rejoicing, for to the Federal army a victory was apparently assured,
      when the hope was suddenly dispelled by the arrival of two divisions of
      the enemy, who, with a loud yell, threw themselves into a gap in Sumner's
      line, forcing him from his position, and across the meadows and
      cornfields, where he made a stand, but the foe retired again to its own
      position.

      at the race. Which will come out ahead, I wonder? They are pretty well
      matched&mdash;both are fleet-footed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a race, indeed. A New Hampshire regiment was marching parallel with
      a Confederate regiment, and each were intent on reaching a certain high
      piece of ground. As they ran, the bullets whizzed <span class="pagenum">[133]</span><a

      pleasantries were kept up.

      &ldquo;The Johnnies are ahead&mdash;no, they have fallen back a little. The New
      Hampshire boys are in the lead now. They've reached the ground. Hurrah!&rdquo;
       shouted Harry, and in his excitement he threw up his cap, and caught it on
      the point of his bayonet. As soon as the winners gained the coveted point,
      they poured shot into their late rivals' ranks.

      they could have formed a foot bridge the entire length of the line.

      &ldquo;Wonder why Porter and Burnside keep so still?&rdquo; This question was asked

      &ldquo;That don't seem to me to be the right policy,&rdquo; said Ralph. &ldquo;But look&mdash;Franklin
      has come up from Crampton's Gap just in the nick of time. He is very
      welcome, for there are fresh troops advancing, from the right flank of the
      boys in gray.&rdquo; Franklin's opportune coming infused new hope, and the boys'
      <span class="pagenum">[134]</span><a name="link134" id="link134"></a>eyes
      brightened, cheery words went round, and muskets were handled with a will.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;General Burnside's orders are to take that bridge. We've got to do it; it
      won't be very much work, and then we'll soon be over to see our friends on
      the other side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think that's easy, do you? Wait and see. We're on low ground here,
      but the land over the other side is higher, and the road runs alongside
      the stream. Those fellows have their guns well placed, and can damage us
      bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bridge they were expected to take, was of stone, and rather narrow.
      The first brigade to attempt to cross was General Crook's.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hark! he's gone the wrong way. The rebels are pouring shot into him.
      He'll be cut all to pieces.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General had struck the wrong road, and was being subjected to a heavy
      fire. A Maryland regiment and a New Hampshire followed him on the double
      quick, but retreated, as they could not stand the fire!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is help for us now,&rdquo; said Ralph, &ldquo;for they are bringing up some
      guns that will speak loud for our side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two heavy guns were soon thundering over the ground, and commanding the
      boys in gray who were guarding the bridge? Their persuasive tones opened
      the passage, and triumphantly the Union men crossed the bridge, and
      secured the position.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four hours had been consumed, and thus General Lee improved his chance to
      bring fresh troops to his aid, who drove Burnside from the heights, and
      retook a battery which he had captured.
    </p>
    <p>
      The battle was over. When the rattle of musketry is heard, the smoke of
      battle, and the wild plunging of the frightened horses, and the shouts and
      fierce onset of a maddened mass of human beings is felt, there is an
      excitement, a fever in the blood that strengthens the arm, and hardens the
      muscles&mdash;thoughts of self are forgotten. But when those
      accompaniments are missing&mdash;when the awful stillness of a deserted
      battle-ground succeeds them, then the heart grows faint and cold.

      Both <span class="pagenum">[136]</span><a name="link136" id="link136"></a>armies
      were glad to rest; both sides had been rent and dismembered. Many
      regiments in both lines had been slaughtered unmercifully. The victory
      belonged to McClellan, but the sorrow and anguish belonged to those who
      loved the fallen ones&mdash;to the friends alike of the blue and the gray,

      Daily papers were a luxury, and the boys in the army were always glad to
      purchase them at a good round price. The newsboy is ubiquitous. He is the
      product of the century, and will never be shelved as are so many useful
      things. Their cries were welcome to those men, who were anxious to know
      what each day was bringing forth and when one galloped into camp, two days
      after the battle of the Antietam with a bag heavily freighted with New
      York dailies, he was surrounded at once, and his stock rapidly melted
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good news!&rdquo; flashed through the ranks as they eagerly devoured the news
      of the battle of Iuka, with Rosecrans at the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a daring attempt,&rdquo; Ralph read aloud to the eager group; &ldquo;the
      account says that the Union forces attacked Price's men in a narrow front,
      with ravines filled with undergrowth, where it was difficult to
      maintaining a foothold, with but one battery, and with hosts against them,
      three to one. Yet they swept down the enemy, and fought till darkness
      overtook them, and in the night the Confederates beat a hasty retreat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This <span class="pagenum">[137]</span><a name="link137" id="link137"></a>news
      cheered the hearts of the boys in blue, and while they were giving vent to
      their joy in different ways, Ralph's heart was filled with a solemn
      thankfulness, for to him it seemed as if One above surely ruled their
      destinies.

    <p>
      HE beautiful <span class="pagenum">[138]</span><a name="link138"      id="link138"></a>autumn days grew shorter. Novembers blasts were keenly
      felt, even in that sunny clime, and the boys looked forward with dismay to
      a winter passed in inaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, we'll have to fight to keep warm,&rdquo; jolly Fred Greene said to the
      comrades gathered round.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Bill had been in hospital for many months. Ralph visited him often,
      and the sick man's face would brighten, and his voice grow
      stronger whenever the boy came to his bedside. But he seemed to have lost
      interest in everything pertaining to this life. Ralph tried earnestly to
      induce him to talk of the events passing around them, but without success.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning early in November, when he went to pay his usual visit, the
      boy said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bill, this is my first experience as a soldier. But you have seen plenty
      of service before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sick man shook his head slowly, but made no reply. Ralph waited a few
      moments, and began to think his question had not been considered worthy of
      an answer, when Bill suddenly spoke:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have been out on the border fighting Indians, for years. How I
      detest the redskins. They seldom come out and give a man a fair show, but
      they just go on the warpath, and then it's skulk and lie in ambush, and
      burn sleeping villages, massacring women and children. Their mode of
      warfare don't suit me.&rdquo; And the disdainful curl of the lip showed what he
      thought of them. After a long pause, he resumed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I was in the Mexican War. I was quite a stripling then, and I fought
      under General Phil Kearney. He was a fighter, <span class="pagenum">[139]</span><a
      name="link139" id="link139"></a>brave as a lion, and when he lost his arm
      not a man under him but would rather it had been his own arm shot away.
      He's one 01 General McClellan's most trusty officers. His experience is
      worth millions to younger men. How I'd like to see noble Phil Kearney!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Bill, didn't you know that he was killed at the battle of Groveton,
      Va., in September?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0102" id="linkimage-0102"> </a>

    <p>
      &ldquo;Kearney killed&mdash;and I've been lying here, and knew nothing about it!
      It's too hard. Let's hear all you know, Ralph.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can only tell you what we heard. You know we wasn't there to see it,
      but he was sent to Hooker's support, when the lat-ter's men charged
      Jackson with bayonets. They had an awful battle, but General Kearney had
      been sent to their assistance too late, and he was forced back. Hooker
      almost broke the enemy's line, but fresh bodies of Confederates hastening
      up, changed the outlook, and so the Union boys were repulsed. At six in
      the afternoon General Pope ordered another attack, and Kearney came up in
      fine style, seizing a railroad cut on the Warrenton turnpike <span
      class="pagenum">[140]</span><a name="link140" id="link140"></a>where
      Jackson was nicely entrenched, and holding it for awhile. One of the
      Confederate regiments who ran short of ammunition, hurled great stones and
      fragments of the rocks at our men, killing many. General Kearney still
      maintained his position, but was overpowered by numbers, and driven out of
      the cut.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ralph paused, but Bill's eyes were gleaming with excitement &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; he
      said, earnestly&mdash;&ldquo;is that all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The two armies rested till the next day, when a still fiercer attempt was
      made to rout the rebels, but in spite of the most stubborn fighting, our
      army was withdrawn from the field, and fell back to Fairfax Court House;
      but the next evening, September 1st, Stonewall Jackson made another attack
      upon General Popes flank, which was resisted hotly, and General Kearney,
      with Hooker, Reno, McDowell and Stevens, were there to help, but General
      Stevens fell dead at their fire, and as all their ammunition had been used
      up, his men retired at once. General Kearney started forward to
      reconnoiter, and was confronted by a Confederate band; he put spurs to his
      horse, hoping to escape, but they shot him dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bill shook his head solemnly, and leaning back on his pillow, he closed
      his eyes, as if he had fallen asleep. Glad to have awakened even so slight
      attention as he had succeeded in doing, the boy continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bill, we have a new commander now. The President has relieved General
      McClellan, and we are to have General Burnside. What do you think of
      that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A look of the old time came into Bill's face, as he answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have a new commander&mdash;one whose call will soon be heard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ralph shuddered. He knew too well the meaning of Bills words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean our army commander, Bill; General McClellan has been relieved of
      his command, and General Burnside has been appointed in his place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;General <span class="pagenum">[141]</span><a name="link141" id="link141"></a>McClellan&mdash;yes,
      he's too slow. It needs some one with a little push. But it's all the same
      to me, now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And that was all he said about the change. He lay on his cot, looking
      intently at Ralph, and suddenly he broke out with&mdash;&ldquo;I don't know why
      I'm so fond of you, boy, unless it's 'cause you mind me of Eddie. He was
      just such a little plucky, fair-faced lad as you are, and I can't help
      mixing you up with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ralph wondered who Eddie was, but he waited patiently. Bill's eyes burned
      with a luster the boy had never seen there before. The sick man's face was
      very thin. The brown tint that outdoor life always gives had faded, and
      the sharp features looked more pinched and wan from their pallor. He went
      on in a weak and trembling voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was a beauty, and I was powerful fond of her. Her eyes were like a
      young fawn's, and her hair was brown as the chestnuts when they ripen in
      the sun. She liked Frank better nor me, and she told me so. Then when they
      were married, I hated him bitterly. But when the little fellow come, and
      they sent for me, somehow from the first time I took the little tot in my
      arms, and he smiled up into my face, all my anger died out. After that I
      would have died sooner than harm his daddy. They were happy with each
      other. But he died when the lad was ten or so, and left the poor wife
      alone. I didn't know how to comfort her, and she grieved continually. One
      day, when he was quite a lad, nearly sixteen, and needed his mother most,
      they found her dead on her husband's grave. Ah, that is the way some women
      love!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That nigh killed me, but I meant to be a good friend to the boy. They
      took even that comfort from me, for they carried him away down South to
      his father's folks, and I never seed him again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man's face was fever-flushed now, and his words came almost in a
      whisper. He tossed uneasily from side to side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ralph, my head bothers me&mdash;it aches so strangely. I wish&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But <span class="pagenum">[142]</span><a name="link142" id="link142"></a>the
      wish was never told. A wild look came over his face, his words became
      incoherent. A delirium had seized him, and kindly as he was tended by the
      nurses and his comrades, he never regained his senses. A few days of
      apparent suffering, and Bill Elliotts kindly heart ceased to beat. The
      uncouth, rugged, but brave soldier had passed on to the Great Beyond.

      It was late in the afternoon of a raw November day, while the winds
      shrieked mournfully, when they carried him to a little valley in which
      they had dug a grave, into whose depth they lowered the body of a brave
      and true soldier, who never shirked a duty. The chaplain, a plain and
      tender, man, read impressively that beautiful Psalm:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From <span class="pagenum">[143]</span><a name="link143" id="link143"></a>the
      end of the earth will I cry unto Thee, when my heart is overwhelmed; lead
      me to the rock that is higher than I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For Thou hast been a shelter for me, and a strong tower from the enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will abide in Thy tabernacle forever. I will trust in the covert of Thy
      wings. Selah.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a clear and ringing voice he read the solemn burial service, and the
      comrades of the dead soldier listened reverently. When he had concluded,
      some one suggested that they sing, and a clear, sweet voice broke
      plaintively into that exquisite hymn,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;<i>Abide with me, fast falls the eventide; </i>
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The darkness deepens&mdash;Lord, with me abide; *
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      When other helpers fail, and comforts flee,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Help of the helpless, O abide with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The voice suddenly broke into a passion of tears, and Ralph threw himself
      on the grave, which was fast being filled up, and cried&mdash;&ldquo;Bill, Bill,
      you were my best friend&mdash;I cannot let you go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There were many looks of sympathy for the boy, but death was, after all,
      nothing but a passing incident to men who faced it every hour, and as
      Ralph went back to his tent, his heart rebelled at the levity which
      allowed the merry jest to pass around, as to whose turn it would be next.
    </p>
    <p>
      To him it was a new experience. He had seen hundreds of men shot down in
      battle, but no one had died whom he had cared for, and it came home to
      him. He had become deeply attached to Bill, whose cheerful, off-hand
      manners had enlivened the homesick boy. He had lost his comrade, but his
      memory was cherished, and he was missed for a long time.

      many forebodings and some outspoken prophecies of failure that many of the
      Union officers learned that they were to move at once upon Fredericksburg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It looks to me like a mad freak to send us out to assault such
      fortifications as are thrown up on the hills south and west of the town.
      It isn't right for a soldier to grumble, but when he sees a man
      perpetrating a piece of folly, that is going to cause a needless sacrifice
      of life, why, he can't help expressing himself as opposed to the scheme.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The plaint of the captain found a ready echo in the hearts of his fellow
      officers, but a soldier must obey instructions unquestioningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early morning hours came, the camp was astir, and all preparations were
      made for a speedy move upon the fortifications.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lee has thrown up forts for five miles will stand any attack that General
      Burnside can make. We are going to our death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A two o'clock breakfast, eaten in haste in the fog of early morning, was
      all that the men were allowed. The outlook was gloomy. The river must be
      crossed, but while Burnside was trying to lay pontoon bridges, the
      engineers were terribly harassed by the continuous fire of the rebel
      sharpshooters, who were using the houses skirting the river bank as places
      of refuge.

      General Burnside determined to try the effect of shelling the town. The
      men who were detailed to lay the pontoon bridges were falling at their
      posts by the rifles in the hands of a Mississippi detachment which was
      hidden securely in cellars, behind walls and fences, and in every corner
      where it was possible to <span class="pagenum">[146]</span><a
      name="link146" id="link146"></a>conceal a man. Crack! crack! their rifles
      were heard, and many a boy in blue was tumbled into the water with a
      bullet in his brain, to be carried away by the current. It was a fruitless
      endeavor to keep on with the work, the loss of life was so great. The
      Federals had better luck at the lower bridges, being able to dislodge the
      sharpshooters from their rifle-pits.

      &ldquo;What are the prospects for crossing?&rdquo; asked Sergeant Gregory of an
      officer who passed at that moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll be over somewhere about doomsday, judging from the outlook. The
      three bridges we need the most can't be laid under the present regime.
      We've got to evict those sharpshooters from the houses along the river
      bank, for it's worse than murder to post our men there to be picked off in
      that cruel fashion&mdash;all to no purpose, for bridges can never be built
      when men are shot down as fast as they show their heads.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The country was hilly, now and then dotted with clumps of trees, while
      barns, fences, and everything that was combustible, had been converted to
      use by the two armies, as each in turn had passed over the land. All was
      dreary and desolate. The sky was leaden-hued, save when a burst of flame
      from the cannonading would lighten it for a short space, and then it would
      die down, leaving it almost a pitchy blackness.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Burnside's resolve to bombard the place had no power to oust the
      sharpshooters, even when tons of shells were thrown into its streets,
      setting fire to many of the buildings. When, after a brief rest, the
      engineers resumed the construction of the bridges, the same result
      followed&mdash;destruction of their numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The town itself was almost impregnable, being completely encircled by
      hills, save on the river side. These heights were bristling with forts,
      entrenchments seamed them in every direction, and batteries were planted
      in such profusion that no opening presented itself for attack. <span

      How long this slaughter would have continued it is hard to tell, <span
      class="pagenum">[148]</span><a name="link148" id="link148"></a>but a happy
      inspiration came to General Hunt, chief of artillery. He suggested that a
      body of men could make a dash for the river, cross in boats, and besiege
      the sharpshooters in the houses, driving them out, and taking possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      The daring of the plan almost took away one's breath, but it seemed the
      only way to silence the enemy's murderous fire, and it was quickly put in
      execution. The pontoon boats lay at the river bank. A band of tried men
      was selected for the perilous undertaking, who at a sign, without a sound
      or word of command, rushed from their concealment, leaped into the boats,
      shot out from the shore, and were half across the stream before the
      Confederates realized their intention. Then came a shower of bullets from
      their rifles, rattling like hailstones about the heads of the brave men,
      who held boards up before them for protection, dodging the murderous fire
      as well as they could, while those who were rowing pulled with a will, and
      the boats were across the stream in swift time. A few were shot, falling
      into the river, but the largest number went over safely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reaching the shore, the regiments ran up the hills, and succeeded in
      forcing the sharpshooters from their lairs, capturing over a hundred of
      them, while the rest fled to the hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      The way was now clear for the completion of the bridges. A pontoon bridge
      is a fine piece of ingenuity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heavy boats, perfectly flat, often twenty feet in length, are anchored at
      equal distances from each other, lengthwise of the current, and beams are
      placed upon them to unite them; then strong, thick planks are laid across
      the beams, thus making a steady, wide roadway, strong enough to endure the
      weight of horses, heavy pieces of artillery, and the tramp of thousands of
      men.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the bridge was being made, the enemy did not remain quiet, but
      dropped shells at various points along the river, which exploded, but
      happily did little injury.

      The smoke of the artillery, the flames bursting from the houses, and the
      struggling army of the Union exposed to a pitiless fire made a picture
      which was never effaced from Ralph's mind, and <span class="pagenum">[150]</span><a
      name="link150" id="link150"></a>years after, when he saw the panorama of
      &ldquo;The Battle of Gettysburg,&rdquo; in Chicago, the memory of that day at
      Fredericksburg came back with vivid force. He was once more a stripling,
      in the midst of the noise and shock of battle, with comrades falling about
      him, torn and mangled out of all semblance of human beings, while he was
      miraculously preserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night the Union forces rested on the ground, in the mud and frost,
      not far away from the pontoon bridge; and though they knew the morning
      would plunge them into further conflict, yet tired limbs and aching heads
      found the refreshing slumber which they needed. Early next morning, after
      a hasty breakfast, they were ready for any events which the day might
      bring forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      A heavy fog hid the other shore, while the air was cold and raw. Long
      before the sun scattered the mists, cannonading began at the bridge, the
      main point of attack, but the firing became so severe that orders were
      issued for them to retire behind the bluffs.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the bridges were finished, and the army crossed to the other side
      of the river, under the continuous shells of the enemy. Now began a
      terrific struggle. General Franklin had advanced against the troops on the
      hill, but they had repulsed him, with much loss. General Meade's division
      was chosen to lead the attack. Down across the railroad they dashed, under
      heavy fire, their skirmishers having been sent forward, while the
      well-directed batteries hurled against the hills did some execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Confederates from their elevated positions poured destruction into
      their ranks, mowing them down. The Union forces were not daunted, but made
      an entering wedge between two rebel divisions, turned back their flanks,
      and captured prisoners and battle flags. Scaling the heights, they were
      met by the second line, which drove them back in confusion, and they were
      only saved from utter rout by General Birney, who threw his command in
      front of the enemy, who were pursuing them.

      class="pagenum">[151]</span><a name="link151" id="link151"></a>and Hancock
      moved in columns through the town, the Confederate batteries burst upon
      them, but they charged across the open ground, to be met by a veritable
      sheet of flame, which swept into their faces, and literally consumed them.
      No bravery, no determination, could withstand that awful fire of the
      enemy, who <span class="pagenum">[152]</span><a name="link152" id="link152"></a>had
      taken advantage of an ambush which nature had seemed to furnish them, from

      A road ran at the foot cf Marye's Hill, which had sunken so much as almost
      to be unobserved, at a little distance. This road was bounded at its
      outside edge by a stone wall, where were hidden two brigades of
      Confederates, who had sent forth this <span class="pagenum">[153]</span>
      <a name="link153" id="link153"></a>sheet of flame and death. Their numbers
      were so great, that every man at the wall was assisted by several behind
      him, who loaded muskets as fast as they could, and passed them to him,
      while he discharged them as rapidly, leaving only his head exposed for an
      instant, as he raised it to take aim.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the face of these fearful odds, the Union soldiers were undismayed. No
      disorganization, no wavering in their ranks, but they kept on, only to
      meet certain death.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now General Hancock, he whose presence was an inspiration, led the
      charge with 5,000 men, whose intrepid daring carried them within twenty
      yards of the fatal wall, only to be beaten back, leaving 2,000 dead to
      tell the tale of the slaughter at Marye's Hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Burnside was beside him himself with rage. In the face of these
      defeats, he demanded that General Hooker make a bayonet charge, and those
      doomed men rushed forward, with a valor never surpassed, rallying again
      and again, until nearly half their number lay dead on the road, or torn
      with fearful wounds.

      The rebel artillery was not idle, but as the Federals retreated, sent
      shells after them, still plowing their numbers with deadly effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      A heavy storm of rain came on in the night, and under cover of its
      inclemency, the Union troops withdrew to the north bank of the
      Rappahannock, although it had been General Burnside's determination <span
      class="pagenum">[154]</span><a name="link154" id="link154"></a>to renew
      the assault the next day, and lead it in person. This was a step which
      needed a vast deal of dissuasion on the part of his generals ere he
      relinquished his mad attempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mud was over the shoe-tops, and the rain was falling fast when the Union
      army received orders to evacuate the town, and no time was lost in
      obeying. The pontoon bridges carried them safely across from the scene of
      disaster, and left the army in a sorry plight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Decimated in numbers, the dead alone counting 12,000, disappointed,
      hospitals full to overflowing, the dead to bury, the predictions of defeat
      had been bitterly realized. It is said that the <span class="pagenum">[155]</span><a
      name="link155" id="link155"></a>brave and dashing General Meagher went
      into that battle with the Irish brigade, over 1,200 strong, and came out
      with a little over 200.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was plain that the men had been sacrificed through incompetency and
      stubbornness. Murmurs and discontent were abundant, as the army prepared
      to settle down in its winter quarters.

    <p>
      FTER the <span class="pagenum">[156]</span><a name="link156" id="link156"></a>slaughter
      at Fredericksburg, Ralph rapidly failed in strength. The excitement of
      that scene of carnage and his increasing exhaustion told upon his frame.
      He fulfilled his duty as well as he could; he was cheerful and alert; he
      wrote more often to his dear mother without ever alluding to his health.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't understand what ails me,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;I have never received a
      wound, while some of the boys who have been badly cut up are well again,
      and seem as strong as ever. I do believe I miss Old Bill more every day. I
      never felt sad or lonely when I had him to cheer me up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He grew daily worse. Often when on duty he would halt, with weak and
      failing breath. He lost all desire for food, and his lusterless eyes and
      pale skin told how he suffered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What seems to be the matter, sergeant?&rdquo; one of his comrades asked,
      anxiously. &ldquo;You don't pear to have any vim about you. Why, if you hadn't
      shown such pluck&mdash;fact is, if it was any one but you, I mout 'cuse
      you of playing off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm all right, Hank. I feel a little weak and have hard chills sometimes&mdash;but
      I'll be better soon. I'm a little sick, that's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's enough. You ain't been yerself since we fit at Fair Oaks I've seen
      it a long time. That malary from the swamps has finished many a strong
      man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At last Ralph had to succumb. His condition was observed by the doctor,
      who called the attention of his captain to the fact that he was no longer
      fit for duty. And when one morning he was not able to report at early
      <span class="pagenum">[157]</span><a name="link157" id="link157"></a>roll
      call, it was with gloomy forebodings that he heard the order that he be
      removed to the hospital at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this the end of my ambitious hopes?&rdquo; he queried. &ldquo;Am I going to die
      when I am willing to serve my country? I would not mind being killed in
      battle, as a soldier should be, but to die in hospital, far from my
      mother. It is hard!&rdquo; And he buried his face in his pillow to hide the hot
      tears that he could not keep back.
    </p>
    <p>
      When weeks passed, and Ralph grew no better, the Colonels attention was
      directed to his case. He was a severe disciplinarian, but he had a kindly
      heart, and he speedily forwarded a recommendation to the war department
      that Sergeant Gregory, Company K, Massachusetts Volunteers, be honorably
      discharged from the service of the United States. A document granting the
      request came back in due time, to the Colonel, who passed it to the
      captain, and he handed it to Ralph, who could not repress his emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I enlisted to the end of the war. I do not want a discharge. Could you
      not have obtained me a sick leave? I know I shall be strong soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor shook his head solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not fit to march, or do active duty&mdash;perhaps' never will be.
      The hardships incident to a campaign have broken you down. You were very
      young to have undertaken them. I do not wish to wound your pride, but the
      government does not want sick men on its rolls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Ralph was given his papers, and after writing his mother a few lines,
      saying that he was quite sick, lest his sudden coming should alarm her, he
      was sent home by the same route by which he came. It was a painful
      journey, not alone from his physical suffering, but his heart bled as he
      noted the ruin that had been wrought in the land&mdash;the deserted
      houses, the neglected fields, miserable-looking people, mostly women and
      children, whose woe-begone faces told of the privations they were daily
      enduring, uncomplainingly. The <span class="pagenum">[158]</span><a
      name="link158" id="link158"></a>contrast between the early days of the war
      and the present was bitter, and he felt how terribly real that war was to
      these people. Their farms had been overrun by the tramping of two armies,
      and each had equally despoiled them of their possessions&mdash;both were
      alike unmindful and indifferent to their sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      But brighter thoughts succeeded these gloomy musings, as he drew nearer to
      his home, and already saw his beloved mother's sweet face, and felt her
      warm kiss upon his cheek. But even in the Western country, as the train
      stopped at the various stations, he noted careworn faces, and anxious
      glances, as the murmured &ldquo;God bless you!&rdquo; was sent after the boys in blue.
      There were several soldiers on the train, some going home on furlough, and
      some on the same errand as Ralph&mdash;going home to recuperate, or,
      perchance, to die.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Ralph reached Chicago, he was glad to lie down on one of the benches
      in the depot. He found he had to wait three hours for the train that would
      convey him to his prairie home. The rest was welcome, and after a nap, and
      a strong cup of coffee, he felt a little better; so much so that he
      thought he would take a short walk of a block or so. The city was, so to
      speak, in holiday attire. The streets were teeming with an excited yet
      happy-looking people, and an unusual bustle pervaded them. He wondered why
      every one was crowding to the edge of the sidewalks, and as he was about
      to ask a bystander, he heard the tramp of many feet. How familiar the
      sound of the steps was to his ear. The boys in blue were coming, he
      thought, and again a wave of wounded pride came over him, as he realized
      that he was shut out from the ranks, by reason of an illness which he
      could not understand or conquer.
    </p>

    <p>
      But no&mdash;these were not his comrades, he saw, as he looked curiously
      at the long procession filing past him, closely guarded by the boys in
      blue, who kept step, while the men they hurried along were the subjects of
      ridicule from the thoughtless crowd. They were prisoners&mdash;these <span
      class="pagenum">[160]</span><a name="link160" id="link160"></a>men, some
      clad in the well-known gray, some wearing butternut suits, some of them
      without coats or hats, their pants frayed and torn clear up to the knees.
      Here would proudly march a clean-shaven, erect young fellow, with a suit
      of gray, scarcely soiled, while at his side a mere shadow of a man, ragged
      and dirty, would shamble along, barefooted and wild-eyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearly all of them were emaciated, while the expression upon their faces
      was one of sullen despair. Men were there who were the flower and chivalry
      of the South, who had staked their lives and fame upon the success of
      their cause, and there were men who scarce knew for what or who they were
      fighting. To the former defeat was bitter humiliation&mdash;to the latter
      capture meant something to eat, and beyond that, they did not look. But to
      the careless crowd who watched them pass, they were merely rebel
      prisoners. No sympathy their anguish and shame was felt; no pity for their
      long months of captivity, when heart and brain would chafe restlessly,
      moved the crowd, who jeered and exulted. It was so, we know, the country
      over. The boys in blue were hooted at and mocked, when the fortunes of war
      threw them into the hands of the enemy. They all forgot that those who
      wore the blue and those who wore the gray were alike animated by a love of
      country, and that all were brothers&mdash;equally brave, equally earnest,
      equally true-hearted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thoughts like these passed through Ralph's mind as he saw the wretched men
      on their way to Camp Douglas, the military prison at Chicago. To him they
      were objects of sympathy, and he shuddered as he asked himself what would
      have been his feelings had he been taken prisoner. He was startled by a
      smart blow upon the shoulder, under whose force he almost staggered. He
      turned in astonishment, and saw Alfred Boneel, a merry French boy, who had
      been a schoolmate of his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Alph, is it possible&mdash;you are looking well. You're as brown as
      a nut, and say, where <i>did</i> you get those whiskers?&rdquo;

      &ldquo;In the service, of course. There's nothing like army life to <span
      class="pagenum">[162]</span><a name="link162" id="link162"></a>bring out a
      man's good qualities. But say, Ralph, I'm sorry I can't return
      compliments. You are neither brown nor rugged looking. What's up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are sending me home as unfit to serve any longer,&rdquo; Ralph replied,
      dejectedly. &ldquo;I don't know why they should single me out for such a
      distinction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you'll come out all right. I see you've done something besides get
      sick, judging by your sergeant's stripes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I won them, and was hoping for something better. But tell me all
      about yourself, Al.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't got much to tell, but I've seen some fighting, too. I was at
      the Fort Donelson scrimmage, and it was the coldest time I ever saw&mdash;snowing
      and blowing, and afterward turning out clear, but bitter cold. The storm
      of rain and snow had been pretty severe, and the fellows who were in the
      trenches must have been frost-bitten. I know we had no shelter and were
      hungry besides, as rations had given out, and had nobody round to ask us
      in to take dinner with 'em. We had pulled up stakes at Cairo, and had to
      go up the Ohio to Smithland, and then up the Cumberland River. Cavalry was
      no good in that country, for there was too much big timber, and the ground
      was too rough. We were kept busy trying to plant a battery, for those
      fellows in gray have some sharpshooters worthy of their name, and though
      not one of them showed himself, it was whiz! pang! every few minutes, and
      some one was sure to go down. We lost Eddie Downing that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Al paused a moment to brush an imaginary fly from before his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eddie Downing was shot? He was a noble boy. So he's dead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Al nodded assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's George Martin? Do you know what regiment he joined?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sure. He was in the gunboat service. Poor fellow, he fared worse than
      Eddie. He was on the Cumberland and had his right arm shot away.&rdquo; <span

    <p>
      &ldquo;He was sent home as soon as the stump healed, and his only regret is, so

      again. But of course they wouldn't have him in any branch of the service.&rdquo;

      &ldquo;We had taken Fort Henry, but didn't feel so certain about Donelson.
      General Buckner had swelled the Confederate numbers there by about ten
      thousand men. Then the fort stood on high ground, and had a fine battery
      on the river front, as well as several lines of strong fortifications on
      the land side, such as immense logs, bags of sand, were well protected,
      and their riflemen were in little pits dug in the side of a hill. All the
      time the weather staid stinging cold, and we suffered terribly. They were
      resting when the gunboats came to the front. Their gunners looked death
      right in the face every instant, but the way they made the shells fly was
      lively. Commodore Foote is a hero, and <span class="pagenum">[165]</span><a
      name="link165" id="link165"></a>he bombarded them in gallant style. He had
      six boats, and the sight was worth seeing, as they would come up toward
      the fort, getting nearer, one by one, and then each delivering its fire,
      and circling round to give the other boats a shot at the rebs. And the
      fort was giving them trouble, too, for they were sending solid shot over
      the decks, which were doing damage.

      &ldquo;When a bomb from the enemy struck the iron plates a terrible racket would
      be heard, as they crashed into them, wrecking smoke pipes, and tearing
      down the rigging, and wounding the crews. The Commodore kept his flagship,
      the St. Louis, in the front. But he received a bad wound in the ankle,
      which did not make him give up, though, but when his boat and the
      Louisville began to fall behind, and they could not be managed, it was
      seen something was wrong. It seems they had their machinery hurt, and
      their steering gear gave out. So he had to stop, for the guns of Fort
      Donelson were making sad havoc with his disabled fleet, and it was found
      that the fort could not be captured by an attack on its water side. The
      flagship had been hit fifty-nine times and the others twenty or thirty
      times apiece, before it became clear that Fort Donelson must be assaulted
      by the land forces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That night kept us all well occupied, in making preparations for the next
      day's fight. That day was an awful one, and hundreds went down before the
      desperate fire of the butternut boys, but we drove them back into their
      entrenchments. Sunday didn't see us ready for church, for we had other
      engagements. The boys in blue had just enough taste of the excitement to
      make them want more, and General Grant had us all up in line of battle
      early in the morning, and we were waiting impatiently for the order to
      attack, when the word flashed along our ranks that an officer carrying a
      white flag had come to visit the General. We knew what that meant&mdash;some
      sort of an understanding, and we were not very sorry after all, for we had
      lost many a gallant soldier, and didn't know who'd be called away next.
      Still, we were ready, if it had to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ralph, I tell you, when we heard that the distinguished looking <span
      class="pagenum">[166]</span><a name="link166" id="link166"></a>gentleman
      on the black horse had come to ask that the battle might be stopped for a
      time, so that they could argue it out on some terms, every man amongst us
      felt like throwing up his hat and hurrahing for the plain, unassuming
      little man who commanded us, when he sent his answer&mdash;'No terms other
      than an unconditional and immediate surrender can be accepted. I propose
      to move immediately upon your works.' That speech is as grand as any
      you'll ever find in history. It will be repeated through all the ages.
      Why, it's good enough to have been uttered by the great Napoleon.&rdquo; Alph's
      eyes glistened, as he unconsciously expanded his chest, and took on a more
      dignified air, as he walked proudly by the side of his friend, who was
      trembling with the effort to keep up with his robust companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The whole world knows what his firm answer did. General Buckner sent
      another flag of truce, with the acceptance of General Grant's terms, and
      the Union troops moved in to Fort Donelson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have been glad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad! Indeed we were. You should have heard us shout and yell. We pulled
      the Confederate colors down in a hurry, and ran up the Union flag. The
      very earth almost shook with the cheering of the boys, while the band
      played 'Star Spangled Banner,' 'Red, White and Blue,' and a dozen other
      patriotic airs. We almost felt like having that bright little ditty 'In
      Dixie's Land' served up to us, we all felt so jubilant. Before an hour had
      gone by, we were on the most friendly terms with them all. We were trading
      off our greenbacks for tobacco, and they were getting bacon and biscuits
      from us. They didn't have any hard feelings against us, and I know we
      didn't have any, for they showed themselves brave and worthy foes wherever
      we met the Confederates in battle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ralph had listened with delight to his description of the taking of Fort
      Donelson. But he suddenly recollected that the train must be due, and he
      reminded Al of the fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's so, and here I am, going home on a furlough, and forgot <span
      class="pagenum">[167]</span><a name="link167" id="link167"></a>all about
      it, while I was spouting. We'll hurry a little; we are only a block or so
      from the depot. You're all out of breath!&rdquo; he said, half alarmed, as he
      observed Ralph's short, quick breathing, and the pallor of his face.
      &ldquo;We'll be there in a jiffy, and you can rest. It's a good thing I'm going
      to be on the same train, for when we reach Marion, I can take you to your
      own place. Pa's expecting me, and we'll drop you down at your own door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was pleasant news to Ralph, for his home was over a mile from the
      station, and he sighed as he recalled how little that distance affected
      him when he was leaving home, but now that he was returning, alas! he knew
      that he could not walk so far.

      OME <span class="pagenum">[169]</span><a name="link169" id="link169"></a>at
      last! And when that longing mother took her boy in her arms once more, and
      looked long and earnestly into his weary face, she saw only the boyish
      Ralph, whom sickness could not change; he was to her the same lad who had
      left his home with strong hopes and sunny smile. True, he was older and
      more careworn looking, but the honest look of his childhood shone from his
      eyes, and the same truthful, frank expression was on his features.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ralph, as he rode up from the depot, with his friends, the Boneels, looked
      around at the old familiar place with eagerness. He expected to find
      everything changed&mdash;he had been absent so long, that to him it seemed
      as though the landscape, even, must have taken on new features, or at
      least changed its old. But there was the same gentle slope in front of the
      door, the same trees in the fields beyond, the same sunny knoll where he
      had played when a little boy. Oh, how long ago that seemed to him, now,
      when he reviewed the experiences of the past four years! Al and his father
      would not enter the house, though cordially invited to do so; they did not
      wish to intrude upon the sacredness of the first meeting with his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could scarcely speak for joy. At last she broke forth with words of
      greeting:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my boy, my boy, you are home once more; you have come home to me, and
      you shall never go away again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad to be with you, dear mother; as glad as a little child, who
      needs a good petting. But it was a bitter disappointment when I found that
      I could not stay with the brave boys who are offering up their lives for
      their country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never <span class="pagenum">[170]</span><a name="link170" id="link170"></a>mind,
      dear boy. You could not help getting sick. I will bring you back both
      health and strength, and then&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then they will take me back in the army, again. Oh, mother, do you
      think it possible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0122" id="linkimage-0122"> </a>

      Her face grew sad. She had not thought of that, and her heart experienced
      a bitter pang, for she felt that not even her love and care were to him so
      sweet and dear as was his country and her cause. It wounded her deeply
      when she saw that even in the flush of his delight at being home again, he
      could not help clouding her joy by expressing a wish that in her bosom
      found no response.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sighed deeply, and made him no answer, but he was so absorbed in
      greeting his sisters and friends who had met to welcome him, that he did
      not notice her silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ralph <span class="pagenum">[171]</span><a name="link171" id="link171"></a>could
      not endure patiently having to play the part of an invalid, but the home
      doctor's peremptory orders were that he should keep his bed, and visitors
      were to be admitted only when he felt as if he were able to talk with
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were many long days when his voice was so faint and his strength so
      nearly exhausted that he was forbidden the excitement caused by their
      presence. But as the winter passed, under the tender ministrations of his
      mother and sisters, hope again sprung up in his breast, that health might
      return to him, and with health would come a return to the service.
    </p>
    <p>
      The medical man was using every effort to restore him to health. He was
      wise, keen-sighted and skillful, and he fathomed the secret of Ralph's low
      vitality. His diligence and care were at length rewarded, and he had the
      satisfaction of seeing the elastic, springing step return, the bright
      color come back to his cheek, and the luster to his eyes, as he grew
      stronger daily, and to those who had come to greet his home-coming, and
      had mentally felt they were taking a last farewell, his recovery seemed
      almost a miracle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon he could walk long distances, and even spring on the back of a horse
      for a ride. Al Boneel had returned to his regiment, but the young man's
      father had sent Ralph a horse, with a suggestion that he should ride every
      day when he was able, a privilege which brought the boy more healing than
      even the doctor's careful attentions.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had instinctively shrank from visiting George Martin, although that
      young man had been to his home three or four times during his illness. It
      was a fine afternoon, and he knew he was able to ride over to George's
      father's farm, over three miles distant. He longed to talk over the war
      with him, and yet he had a feeling of delicacy lest George might be
      sensitive about any reference to his own misfortune. But he could not help
      going, and he found George sitting on a bench in the orchard, where the
      green buds were just beginning to shoot forth their promise for future
      abundance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm <span class="pagenum">[172]</span><a name="link172" id="link172"></a>glad
      indeed to see you able to come down here, Ralph,&rdquo; was George's cordial
      greeting. &ldquo;I've been wishing all day for some one to talk over old times
      with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old times! Yes, we were happy, good-for-nothing lads in those days, I
      know, and gave our teachers lots of uneasiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So we did, but I don't refer to those days; I mean the days in the army.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ralph was all attention at once. &ldquo;How did you like the service?&rdquo; he
      ventured.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0123" id="linkimage-0123"> </a>

    </div>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Liked it clear through&mdash;way down to the bottom. You know how I lost
      my arm?&rdquo; he said, pointing to the empty sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ralph nodded. He longed to know more of the particulars, but would not
      ask.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was a great day. You should have been there, and seen a real fight.
      Not that a fight on land ain't all right, but there's a dash and
      inspiration about a battle on board ship that I enjoy! You feel as if the
      boat were your castle&mdash;you can't get away from it, and you're bound
      no one else shall get into it. Then the waves rocking beneath your feet,
      the shells screaming and dancing over the water, and the thought that your
      boat is almost a living thing, lends you a desperation nothing else can
      equal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ralph smiled faintly. To his way of thinking those sensations were common
      to all who went into battle, whether on land or water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know when I went into the service I made my way to <span
      class="pagenum">[173]</span><a name="link173" id="link173"></a>Washington
      at once. I didn't wait to be enlisted here, but I knew Uncle Dick, who
      lived there, could get me onto a war-ship, and he did.

      &ldquo;Through his influence I went on the Cumberland. She was a wooden vessel,
      but stanch and trim, with a good commander, <span class="pagenum">[174]</span><a
      name="link174" id="link174"></a>Lieutenant Morris, whom we all liked. He
      was brave, resolute and determined. The Merrimac, under Commander Franklin
      Buchanan, was trying to raise the blockade, and do us all the harm she
      could. She was steaming round Hampton Roads, waiting to sink any of the
      boats that were maintaining that blockade. Commodore Buchanan evidently
      fancied he had an easy job on hand, but as soon as we sighted the
      ungainly-looking craft, our hearts were made glad with orders to pour a
      broadside into her, which we lost no time in doing. We tried our best to
      destroy her, but her heavy iron plates withstood the assault. Had she been
      made of wood, we would have made a sieve of her with our charge. We did
      her some damage, though, for our shot went clear into her open ports, and
      killed some of her crew. I heard some one say when a man's hit he don't
      cry out, but I know better, for the shrieks of the wounded on both sides
      that day, mingled with the roaring of the shells, the crashing of shot
      against the iron-sheeted monster, and the confusion of voices as orders
      rang out, sound in my ears yet.

    <p>
      &ldquo;Lieutenant Morris would not say die, and when the rifled shot from the
      big house, for that's what it looked like, tore our decks fore and aft,
      the Merrimac's commander followed it up by turning his boat so that he
      rammed into our gay little vessel's side, and left a huge gash. Our
      commander's blood was up. We felt the frigate slowly settling beneath our
      feet, but not a man dreamed of forsaking his gun, but steadily poured fire
      into the Merrimac. We were willing to die, rather than surrender, and even
      though the breath came quick and hard, and we may have quailed a little as
      we looked at our watery grave, yet we waited calmly to hear our leader's
      orders, while the enemy was dealing us terrible blows with shot and shell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I felt a sharp pang, a numbness followed. The whole world was growing
      black, and for a second I thought the night had suddenly settled over us,
      and I knew no more, until one day I woke up in hospital, and found my
      right arm and shoulder had parted company. A <span class="pagenum">[175]</span><a
      name="link175" id="link175"></a>messmate told me what happened after I
      fell to the deck. Our brave commander would not surrender; the water rose
      steadily, or, rather, the Cumberland sank steadily, until the waves washed
      across her gun deck, when the crew sprang overboard, and the ships boats
      carried them ashore.

      &ldquo;Tom said it was a sickening sight&mdash;they had done us great havoc, but
      all of our wounded who could be dragged into the boats were saved, myself
      among the number. Tom said it was a gloomy sight when the trusty frigate
      keeled over, and sank to the bottom, but she went down game, for her
      top-masts stood above the water, with her flag flapping in the face of the
      Merrimac and her commander.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      George paused. A sparkle was in his eyes, and he laughed aloud at his own
      idea. He continued: &ldquo;But I had my revenge when I heard about the Monitor
      giving it to the Merrimac. You know Ericsson invented that queer boat.
      It's a curious affair. You never saw it? It looks for all the world like a
      big cheese box, with a round chimney or turret on it. This turret carries
      two monstrous guns, <span class="pagenum">[176]</span><a name="link176"      id="link176"></a>and it can be turned round so that they can be pointed in
      any direction.

      &ldquo;The mischief she did was something worth talking about. Lieutenant John
      L. Worden commanded her, but he met with a mishap at the start. He was
      looking through the sight hole, taking observations, when a shell struck
      it, and hurt him badly, making him blind for a time, and he had to turn
      over the command to Lieutenant Sam Greene. The two boats kept on fighting
      wildly, each trying to ram the other. Why, they came so close once in the
      fight, that both guns went off together, causing such a shock that the
      crew at the after guns were knocked down, and some of them bled at the
      nose and ears. They fought four hours, so the paper stated, and the
      Merri-mac went back to Norfolk, badly used up, for they put her in dry
      dock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      George would have talked on all night, it seemed, but Ralph, who had
      enjoyed the brief story of the sea-fight, said he must go, as the sun
      would soon be down. But that visit was but one of many which he made to
      George, and each one increased his anxiety to return to the army. He was
      gaining health under his mother's care and the long rest he was having,
      and he often laughingly declared that if the regimental doctor could see
      him now, he'd never believe in his own predictions again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grateful as his mother was for his restoration to health, yet it saddened
      her, for she saw it was useless to keep him back, for he talked of nothing
      else but returning to the army. She felt <span class="pagenum">[177]</span><a
      name="link177" id="link177"></a>that he had done his duty, and she could
      not see why that did not content him. But she realized that it did not;
      she saw that he was determined to go, and her heart sank like lead in her
      bosom at the thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day for parting came, and as Ralph, with a few other soldiers who were
      returning to their regiments, started for the great city beyond, from
      which they were to proceed to the front, she thought her heart would break
      at this second leave-taking. Her boy loved her more dearly than she knew;
      but he honestly thought his duty to his country was above any private
      considerations, and that he should be guilty of a great sin if he did not
      return to that duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The news from the front was most inspiring. Each day the &ldquo;war news&rdquo; was of
      more absorbing interest. Ralph wanted to be back with the army. He had no
      longer any ambition to win any especial distinction, but he was content to
      do his part as one of the vast army of great heroes of whom the world will
      never hear, but whose whole duty was done, quietly and unobtrusively.
    </p>
    <p>
      How many sublime acts of self-sacrifice, of generous comradeship, were
      performed, on the field of battle, in camp and hospital, and even in
      prison life, will never be known. But a record has been kept in a higher
      ledger than a worldly one, and when that is revealed these deeds will come
      to the knowledge of all men.<span class="pagenum">[178]</span><a

      NCE <span class="pagenum">[179]</span><a name="link179" id="link179"></a>again
      our hero was in Chicago. The city had put on its spring dress, and well
      was it named the Garden City, for the streets at that time were nearly all
      bordered with trees, and their green foliage gave it, at a little
      distance, the appearance a wooded plain, for the city is built on level
      ground&mdash;indeed, it was once a swamp, and it has cost the labor of
      years and an outlay of millions of dollars to reclaim it from its original
      state, and fill in and grade and elevate its highways.
    </p>
    <p>
      The terrible battle of Chancellorsville had been fought, under General
      Hooker (&ldquo;Fighting Joe,&rdquo; as the soldiers loved to call him), and a victory
      had resulted for the Union army. The news electrified the North, and great
      results were predicted. General Hooker had been given the command after
      the utter failure of General Burnside at Fredericksburg, and his soldiers
      were ready to follow him to the death, for he was intrepid and fearless.
      This memorable engagement had been fought with Hooker on the Federal
      forces, and Stonewall Jackson, the brave Confederate leader on the
      Confederate side. He was General Lee's right hand man, the ablest and best
      Lieutenant he ever had. Close upon this victory came the news that General
      Jackson had been shot by his own men. When the shades of evening began to
      fall, he rode to the front to see what could be learned of the movements
      of the Federals, and as he rode back to his own lines, surrounded by his
      staff, some of his own followers, watchful and faithful to their duty, not
      recognizing him in the dim twilight, but mistaking the mounted men for
      cavalry belonging to the Union side, fired a volley at them, <span
      class="pagenum">[180]</span><a name="link180" id="link180"></a>killing
      several of the horsemen, and wounding others. This was, of course,
      supposed to be an attack from some of the Union soldiers, and to them was
      imputed the firing. The Confederate loss in the day's encounter had been
      severe, and they smarted at their defeat, They had been met by such a
      storm of grape and canister as no mortal power could withstand. The charge
      of Major Peter Keenan, which had been ordered by General Pleasanton, had
      been so brilliant that it had surprised the Confederates, who could not
      believe that Keenan, with four hundred men, would dare oppose ten thousand
      of their infantry, and they concluded that tremendous numbers must be
      behind them. The Major, with his little band, was slain, but his charge
      stopped the onset of the Confederates.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stories of individual bravery which are furnished by the annals of the
      conflict, are alone enough to fill a volume, but will probably never be
      written. The heroic Major knew that he was inviting death, but he never
      faltered. Indeed, his own words were to that effect, for he said to his
      officers, &ldquo;It is the same as saying we must be killed, but we'll do it.&rdquo;
       And his words proved prophetic, for he fell, and but few came out of that
      engagement alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The twilight was falling, veiling every object in its uncertain light, the
      trees cast their dark shadows over the path which General Jackson had
      chosen. As his men, ever watchful, saw the result of their first volley,
      they became exultant at their success, and again they loaded their guns,
      discharging them at the form of the leader of the approaching party, who
      had thus singularly fallen into their hands. They knew that they had
      wounded an officer, and as he fell from his seat, they rushed forward to
      learn his rank and name, if possible. Alas, to their consternation, they
      discovered that their beloved commander, General Jackson, had received
      three wounds. His steed, mad with fright, plunged wildly forward, and
      dashed into the depths of the thicket, tossing him against the limbs of
      the trees in his path, and bruising him most severely.

      Bounties had been offered in all the Northern States. New York was
      offering liberal sums to recruits. The new levy for 300,000 men ordered in
      April had not been filled, and trouble was anticipated, as a draft had
      been threatened. But in Chicago no such fears disturbed her people.

      Ralph <span class="pagenum">[184]</span><a name="link184" id="link184"></a>found
      that city full of activity. Groups were gathered on every street corner
      discussing the war and their hopes of its probable early ending. The South
      had suffered severely in loss of men and means, and so had the North. Many
      a family could point to the &ldquo;vacant chair&rdquo; and lament the dear one who had
      gone, never to return. Death had been busy at every fireside and the cruel
      war had wrought the havoc.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the spirit of patriotism was not dead, but burned more brightly than
      ever, and those who had lain down their lives were embalmed in the hearts
      of a grateful people. They fell in a sacred cause, and their memories will
      live forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ralph walked through the streets with a hopeful step. He had won his
      mother's free consent to go to the front, but little did he dream how far
      from willing the consent she had spoken was. He knew, too, that her
      blessing accompanied him everywhere, and he wished he could see her now,
      and tell her how happy he was. Turning down a street near the river, he
      saw a crowd standing round an office, on whose front was a big poster,
      with the words&mdash;&ldquo;Recruits wanted&mdash;Enlist here!&rdquo; Stepping in at
      the door, he saw a motley crowd of men pushing and jostling each other in
      their desire to be among the earliest to be enrolled. A military man sat
      at a desk, with a huge book open before him, and two officers sat near at
      desks, writing busily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ralph made known his business as soon as he could engage the officer's
      attention. He was questioned as to his age, occupation, and many other
      particulars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say you've been in the army already?&rdquo; the officer queried, while he
      looked earnestly into the boy's face. &ldquo;How is it that you are here now,
      trying to re-enlist? Why did you not serve your time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got sick, really sick, sir,&rdquo; as he saw a smile flit over the other's
      face. &ldquo;I did not want to come home, but the doctor said I would surely die
      if I remained. I received a discharge and went home to mother, and she
      cured me all up, and I am well&mdash;well, and stronger than ever. And now
      I want to go back to <span class="pagenum">[185]</span><a name="link185"      id="link185"></a>the boys in the army, and help them finish this contract
      they have taken, to bring the South back into the Union. Yes, I want to
      enlist 'for the war.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the boy concluded, his eye grew bright, his cheeks were flushed, and
      his form seemed to expand with the strength of his emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The officer seemed to enjoy his earnestness, and writing down his name,
      age, and place of birth, passed him over to the doctor for examination. He
      passed satisfactorily, and thankfully he heard the verdict of the doctor.
      He was sent to military headquarters, and then he was assigned to the
      Seventy-second Illinois Infantry. That regiment was the first one
      organized by the Board of Trade of Chicago. It was then at Milliken's
      Bend, after having tried in vain to make the Yazoo Pass. A canal had been
      ordered dug by General Sherman in a bend opposite Vicksburg, into which he
      was confident he could divert the river, but this plan was checked by the
      sudden rising of the river, and it was only by a miracle that entire
      regiments escaped drowning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The attempt afterward made by General Grant to enter this Pass had proved
      equally disappointing, even though an embankment which the Confederates
      had thrown up had been as promptly blown up by him. His boats entered the
      streams, whose banks had heavy growths of timber, only to find that the
      Confederates had cut down trees of immense bulk, and thrown them across
      the channel. But General Grant kept on, removing the fallen, trees that
      blocked the way, but he at once discovered that he was placing himself in
      a trap, for the rebels were felling trees and throwing them across the
      channel behind him, so that he could not get out again. They had also
      raised earthworks at a point where two rivers met, and they were well
      guarded.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was one forlorn chance left, yet untried, and that was to go up the
      Yazoo a short distance, in boats, and pass into Big Sunflower River, and
      then descend that stream into the Yazoo again. This hazardous expedition
      was intrusted to Generals Sherman and Porter, to carry forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <span class="pagenum">[186]</span><a name="link186" id="link186"></a>situation
      was desperate. The channels were narrow, there was no solid ground on
      which to plant troops, the cane-brake was dense and nearly impassable, and
      they actually had to pick their way through the dark and uncanny swamp by
      the aid of candles. It was inviting death too openly to proceed, for,
      added to natures horrors, the whole region swarmed with sharpshooters to
      whom every step of the way was familiar, and whose unerring aim told
      heavily all along the lines of the Federals, who were glad to escape from
      the narrow pass.

      Commodore Farragut, with one gunboat and his flagship, had shot by the
      batteries at Port Hudson, and several boats had passed Vicksburg. On the
      night of April 16 Commodore Porter ran by the batteries, but the watchful
      enemy had provided for this move, and suddenly setting fire to huge heaps
      of wood on the bank, a brilliant flame darted up to the heavens, and by
      its light for an hour and a half they sent a heavy fire into the fleet,
      which as industriously returned the courtesy as it steamed past its <span
      class="pagenum">[188]</span><a name="link188" id="link188"></a>adversary.
      But the Federal fleet met with no loss save the sinking of one transport.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was some of the history of the campaign which the regiment to which
      Ralph was sent had taken part in, and the thought of joining it gave him
      unbounded delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was not contented, dear mother,&rdquo; he wrote to her a few days later,
      &ldquo;until I was back with the boys in blue. This is a lovely country. When
      this war is over, I'll bring you down here, and we'll spend our days where
      nature has done so much for her creatures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Down the river they steamed. When they reached Milliken's Bend, Louisiana,
      their corps united with Grant's army in its memorable march on Vicksburg.
      Ralph was on the alert to see all that he could of the country. But there
      were no signs of aught but desolation. Fences had been torn down, and
      consumed to cook the camp fare on marches; here a pile of charred timber
      told where a house had once reared its stately head; a few half-starved
      animals roamed round an old, deserted place, in search of the food they
      needed. Poverty, devastation and ruin were evident everywhere, and spoke
      plainly of the blight that followed in the wake of the armies that had
      tramped over and destroyed the beautiful homes of former days.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning of May 16, they reached Champion's Hill, where they found
      severe work. General Sherman had been left at Jackson to destroy the
      railroad, and the factories which were making goods for the Confederate
      soldiers. He performed this task with thoroughness. He now received orders
      from General Grant to send forward an ammunition train, so as to be ready
      for the battle that must take place soon. He was not disappointed. At
      Champion's Hill, on rising ground, he found General Pemberton waiting to
      receive him, with 23,000 men drawn up in line. His force held the vantage,
      as they were stationed on high ground, commanding three roads, and thus it
      was admirably calculated for a defensive point.

      For hours the fighting went on. The Union force's made a overwhelming
      <span class="pagenum">[190]</span><a name="link190" id="link190"></a>charge,
      and the rebel lines wavered, but speedily regained their position. It was
      a desperate duel, and fought to the death.

      General Pemberton had a splendid army of well-disciplined men, and when
      the two lines met with impetuosity, the day seemed lost to the Federals.
      General Logan saw the danger threatening them, and pushing forward on the
      right with his magnificent division, he passed the rebel General's left
      flank, and secured the only road by which the latter could make his
      retreat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The enemy were dismayed. Cut off from escape, they knew defeat was
      inevitable. The movement of Logan had been so sudden and brilliant that
      there was not a moment of grace given them. But that General was not
      conscious that he held the road in his grasp, and when General Hovey, who
      was besieged vigorously by the Confederates, a few moments later, shouted
      for aid, Logan fell back to his assistance.

    <p>
      Now was their chance, for the road was left unguarded, and a dash was made
      by General Pemberton, whose flying columns were <span class="pagenum">[192]</span><a
      name="link192" id="link192"></a>in full retreat, without giving a thought
      to his dead and wounded, left uncared for on the field. He also abandoned
      thirty guns, and crossed the Big Black River.
    </p>
    <p>
      The battle was over, and to the opportune move of the brave Logan was due
      the hard-won success of the day. Four hours of hard fighting had been
      followed by the usual harvest of dead and maimed. Nurses and hospital
      stewards succored all whom they could find, but wounded men were lying
      between the lines and in every corner, groaning with the anguish of
      uncared for injuries. Among those lost on the Confederate side was General
      Tilghman, who fell early in the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The soldiers found a brief rest in sleep. Ralph had thrown himself on the
      ground in a state of perfect exhaustion. He would not confess, even to
      himself, that he had overrated his strength. But when the stars came out,
      and the silence of night succeeded, nature asserted her rights, and he
      slept undisturbed by dreams of carnage and bloodshed, but his visions were
      of home and its charms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wake up, young fellow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sprang to his feet, while a man of about forty, who had been shaking
      him violently, said, with a hearty laugh:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're something of a sleeper. Rip Van Winkle is nowhere. Reveille has
      sounded, the regiments are ready to move as soon as we get a cup of
      coffee, and you've been sleeping through it all, as sweetly as if you were
      in your little bed at home. It's a mighty fine thing to have a clear
      conscience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the pleasant-faced soldier gave Ralph a gentle push as he gathered
      himself up, and made a jump for one of the fires that were burning in
      different spots, kindled by the hungry men to boil their coffee, or cook a
      bit, before they took up the march again. The other followed closely at
      his heels, and sitting on a fallen log they were soon busy &ldquo;fortifying
      their inner man,&rdquo; amid much laughing and chaffing going on around them.
    </p>
    <p>
      That is a marked trait of the American soldier, be he from North or South.
      No amount of hardship, no deprivations, can destroy that love of fun which
      is inborn. He is always ready to <span class="pagenum">[193]</span><a
      name="link193" id="link193"></a>see the comic side of all situations, as
      he merrily laughs at danger, and jokes almost in the very presence of
      death.
    </p>
    <p>
      That day General Pemberton was overtaken at the Big Black. Here he had
      stationed his main body on high land, but on the east of the stream the
      ground was low and wet, and on this spot the remainder of his command was
      held.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have got to dislodge Pemberton from his position,&rdquo; Ralph heard a
      comrade say. &ldquo;He has a splendid view of all we are doing, and can make a
      stanch resistance. But we'll soon set him running again, and he'll have to
      find a better lookout than the one he now occupies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See!&rdquo; shouted Ralph. &ldquo;General Lawler is leading the attack on their right
      flank. They give way&mdash;they fall back! The General is in his shirt
      sleeves, and looks as if he were in earnest!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shouldn't wonder if he was. He's a hard one to tackle, and won't stand on
      ceremony. He don't go into battle in a full dress suit. Just look over
      there. Pemberton is retreating, skedaddling. His men have set fire to that
      bridge, and how is he going to cover the retreat of his rear guard down
      there in the bayou?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's not trying to save them at all, but is looking after No. One. By
      George, he's off, and has left those poor fellows to be captured, or shot
      down, he don't care which.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was true. He ran away in mad haste, making no effort to cover their
      retreat, but abandoned the panic-stricken men in the lowland to their
      fate. Wild with terror, with no leader to direct, many of them flung
      themselves into the river, only to sink beneath the waters, and those who
      were left were taken prisoners by the Federals. <span class="pagenum">[194]</span><a

      ENERAL <span class="pagenum">[195]</span><a name="link195" id="link195"></a>GRANT
      set to work at once building bridges by which to cross the Big Black.
      General Sherman's corps were soon busy felling trees and laying planks. A
      raft bridge was now constructed, and a bridge was also hurried together,
      with cotton bales for pontoons. The next step was to cut trees on each
      side of the river in such a manner that their trunks were not severed, but
      clung to the stumps. In falling across the stream, their boughs met and
      grasped each other firmly, and the planks laid across them made a secure
      road, over which the troops passed, while the two Generals, Grant and
      Sherman, sat on a log and watched the living mass of blue-coats march
      over, with the smoky, ruddy light of pitch pine torches throwing their
      weird shadows over the scene. It was a wild and picturesque panorama. The
      vast body of human beings moving fearlessly across the swaying structure,
      the fitful gleams of light reflecting from their muskets, the two great
      generals sitting there as calmly as though watching a festive procession&mdash;the
      somber depths of the forest on either side, where danger lurked in many
      shapes&mdash;what heart could fail to be impressed by the solemn
      spectacle?
    </p>
    <p>
      By the morning of the 18th that vast army had crossed to the west side of
      the river, but the rebel general had not waited to receive them, but
      flown, without attempting to give them battle. He hastened to the city of
      Vicksburg, behind whose walls he found shelter. He was speedily followed
      by Grant, who got his army in position, placing General Sherman on the
      right of the line, General McPherson on the left of Sherman, and
      McClernand next, his command touching the river below Vicksburg. Sharp
      resistance was offered, and the Confederates lost ground in <span
      class="pagenum">[196]</span><a name="link196" id="link196"></a>a skirmish
      on the 19th, but made an onset which almost regained it for them, but the
      National troops checked their assault and moved to a more advantageous
      position. The Federal forces were nearly famished, for rations for five
      days had to do duty for three weeks, eked out by what they could
      confiscate from the people as they marched through the country, one of
      General Grant's first steps was to make roads in the rear of his line, so
      that supplies could be obtained more easily. These roads ran through
      swamps and miry places, where no team could force its way.

      &ldquo;We are expecting an attack from Johnston. He has been laid up with the
      wound he received at Seven Pines, and has all the Mississippi forces under
      him,&rdquo; Ralph's captain said to him. &ldquo;Our line of defences is thrown out six
      or seven miles, so I hear,&rdquo; answered Ralph. &ldquo;We are well prepared for
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true, but we may look for an attack in our rear. McClernand

      heights were fortified strongly, earthworks rearing their heads for miles,
      bristling with guns, against which the Union army hurled its strength in
      vain. Grants purpose was to carry the works by storm, but though splendid
      courage was shown, and the color-bearers at many points reached the
      breastworks and planted flags upon them, they proved impregnable.

      saw their efforts, he could not repress his enthusiasm, but shouted&mdash;&ldquo;Hurrah!
      Our flag is floating on the breeze. We shall soon be in the city!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His excitement was contagious, and with a ringing shout the advancing men
      hurled themselves vigorously against the obstructions, only to be driven
      back slowly but surely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;General Grant has just received a dispatch saying that McClernand has two
      forts of the enemy in his possession. A brigade has been sent to his aid,
      and firing has been resumed-Boys, at them with a will!&rdquo;

    <p>
      As <span class="pagenum">[200]</span><a name="link200" id="link200"></a>they
      entered a cut in the road, Ralph saw the color sergeant of one of the
      Illinois regiments, who could scarcely stand from fright. The balls were
      whistling by their ears, the leaves of the trees were falling in showers,
      scattered by the rifles' fire. The man was ashy pale, and his knees
      trembled so he could not stand erect. Ralph thought of what he had related
      to boys months ago, about the French soldier, but this, he saw, was not a
      parallel case, for this man was clearly a coward, and as he watched him,
      he expected to see him fall down, and trail the colors after him. The man
      saw that he was observed, and he made one desperate effort to raise
      himself to his full height, but suddenly the pleasant-faced man who had
      taken interest in Ralph sprang forward, wrested the flag from the cowardly
      fellow, and carried it valiantly to the front.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ralph looked for the sergeant. He had shrunk to the rear, and was busy
      hiding behind a huge tree which towered above the field.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank heaven!&rdquo; said Ralph, &ldquo;our flag was saved.&rdquo; He felt sure that his
      new friend, who was corporal of the color guard, would be rewarded in some
      way, but the soldier who had rescued the flag, when summoned before the
      commanding officer, and offered promotion to color sergeant, promptly
      refused it, unless the one who had so belittled his trust were reduced to
      the ranks. This was not done, for some reason, but the man who had rescued
      the colors was made a sergeant&mdash;a deserved promotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rumor proved false, for General McClernand, so far from taking the two
      forts, had been repulsed, and the men who were sent to help him were many
      of them killed; they were made the victims of a misstatement, to put it as
      mildly as possible. A short time after, General Grant relieved him of
      further responsibility, and General Ord succeeded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      This assault was a costly one, for two thousand five hundred men were
      sacrificed, and Grant determined to besiege the city. He went to the rear,
      earth-works were thrown up, and mines were dug under the fortifications.
      By day and by night the big guns were booming <span class="pagenum">[201]</span><a
      name="link201" id="link201"></a>across the space, which daily grew
      narrower, as the Union soldiers brought the trenches nearer to the line of
      defense. Those were days that tried their courage and patience, but not a
      murmur was heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day a great commotion took place among the soldiers. Three objects
      were seen whirling through the air, and fell in the Union lines, within
      five feet of where Ralph was standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it? Where did it come from?&rdquo; was the query, as several hastened
      to the spot, to find three men, two white ones lying on the ground dead,
      and one negro nearly so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something struck some one that time,&rdquo; Corporal Calvin Strong said. &ldquo;See&mdash;the
      colored man's coming to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so he was, and as he raised up, he began to rub his head, and look
      wildly about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, he's contraband of war, and we must confiscate him,&rdquo; the Corporal
      continued, laughingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whar&mdash;whar be I? Is dis yere de bottomless pit?&rdquo; the black man
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Sam, you've arrived at your proper destination, and now you've got
      to be flogged every day, until your sins are all paid for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, massa, spare a poor cullered boy who neber did nuffing wuss den steal
      a chicken, or grab a few eggs. Neber did no mo'.&rdquo; And falling on his knees
      he began to jabber away in pure fright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get up, you black rascal; you're in the Union lines now,&rdquo; Sergeant Harmon
      said, as he pulled the shaking darkey to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bress de Lawd! In de Union? I'se whar I'll git sumfin to eat, now, sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How far did you come, Sam?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bout free miles. I'se come to stay, too. I'll neber go back dar any mo'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Black Sam did stay, and made one of the most faithful of servants. He
      often referred to his first appearance among the soldiers. When the mine
      exploded at Fort Hill, it killed the <span class="pagenum">[202]</span><a
      name="link202" id="link202"></a>two white men, but by some miracle Sam
      escaped, and when he recovered consciousness, and found himself surrounded
      by men black with powder and dust, he had really fancied that he had
      landed in a certain world where they tell us cold is unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Day after day the noise of the great guns was heard. Shells were thrown
      into the beleaguered town, and much injury was inflicted. Vicksburg at
      this time might be called a city of caves, for they were dug in the banks
      wherever a street was cut through a clayey hill, and these caves were
      tenanted by entire families, who lived in comparative safety, while shells
      and balls were whizzing over their heads. Nor did the darkness bring a
      cessation of hostilities, the night proving no barrier to Grant's vigorous
      attack. As the two lines came nearer together, a mutual understanding was
      had, after this fashion:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Yank, how are you getting along?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, fine. We'll soon be over there to see you. Have the ice-cream and
      cake all ready, for it's a hot day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that'll be 'all right. We'll freeze you out sure. Say, you come up on
      top where we can get a look at you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you'll put your old guns away, and not pop at us, we'll come up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a bargain. We promise. But you must do the same by us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agreed&mdash;that's fair enough.&rdquo; And true to their word, they would show
      themselves, and a running fire of jokes and ridicule would be launched at
      each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Johnnie, how are the hotels over there? Engage us rooms at the best
      one, for we want good accommodations when we get there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have everything fine, and are waiting to receive you in first-class
      shape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good eating?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The choicest cuts of mule-steaks, roasts, soups, any shape you order it.
      Say, Yank, what's the news your way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, were having a jolly time. We've got everything we want, <span
      class="pagenum">[203]</span><a name="link203" id="link203"></a>save your
      town, and when we get that, the old mud stream will be open for a sail way
      down to the Gulf.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you won't take your sail very soon, then, for you'll never get
      Vicksburg. Say, have yer got any terbacker?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lots of it. Want some?&rdquo; Then the exchange would be made, and after this
      friendly pause, both sides would resume hostilities, as earnestly as ever.

      Work in the trenches brought the prospect of subduing the almost
      invulnerable heights nearer and nearer. Famine threatened the besieged
      city, with its horrors. Forty-four days had been consumed in laying siege.
      Soldiers lay down in the same clothes which they had worn through all
      these weary weeks of bloodshed and resistance.

    <p>
      General Pemberton sent a flag of truce to General Grant, and negotiations
      were carried on, but the Federal commander was now prepared for a final
      grand assault. The Fourth of July was near, supplies had given out within
      the walls, and the Confederate general, who had held out bravely,
      surrendered without making any conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Grant took possession in a most magnanimous manner. By his express
      command not a man of his army was permitted to cheer; not a single salute
      was fired, and silently, with dignity and generosity, the half-starved
      Confederates were fed bountifully, the Union soldiers emptying their own
      knapsacks, and giving their contents to <span class="pagenum">[204]</span><a
      name="link204" id="link204"></a>them. All the prisoners taken at Vicksburg
      and those at Port Hudson were paroled, under the supposition that they
      would return to their homes, and await a proper exchange.

      War has its humor as well as peace. The help afforded by Porters fleet and
      Farragut's had been considerable during the siege. The Confederates had
      sunk the Indianola, one of Porter's boats, and were trying to raise it,
      when they saw a monitor coming down full upon them. Admiral Porter had
      fitted up an old flatboat with pork barrels for smoke stacks, and furnaces
      made from mud, in which a fire had been started. He sent it sailing down
      the river, with not a human being on board, to the evident terror of the
      Confederates, who were watching her and who fired point blank at her,
      without stopping the supposed monitor. Dreading lest they would lose their
      prize, they promptly blew up the Indianola, before they discovered that
      they were sold.

      The colored folks all through the war had shown very friendly feelings
      toward the Union army, as many an act of kindness at their hands had
      testified. Those who came into camp, as well as the white refugees, were
      put to various labors. Surely no race, save the African, ever produced
      such a quantity of culinary artists, judging from the claims they set up.
      Whenever a darkey was queried as to his calling, whether he had been a
      field hand or a house servant, he always answered that he was &ldquo;a fust-rate
      cook, massa; can gib yo' some fust-class dishes.&rdquo;

      &ldquo;Still more good news, boys; General Lee has been routed at Gettysburg,
      and several of his generals killed or wounded. Among the latter is General
      Wade Hampton. Lee's brilliant sortie has been checked by three of the
      hardest days' <span class="pagenum">[206]</span><a name="link206"      id="link206"></a>fighting ever witnessed in this war. Both armies fought
      like demons. But we have driven Lee and his followers off the soil of
      Virginia. General Meade, the master spirit, has given them a taste of his
      fine generalship.

      ground, for I was born three miles from there,&rdquo; said another man.

    <p>
      &ldquo;How strange,&rdquo; said Ralph, &ldquo;that two such glorious victories should follow
      each other&mdash;Gettysburg in the East, and Vicksburg in the Southwest.
      General Lee has been instructed that an invasion of the North is
      impossible, and we have cut the Confederacy in two by opening the
      Mississippi to navigation from Cairo to the Gulf. Surely, the God of
      battles is on our side,&rdquo; he reverently continued, for Ralph knew that
      without His overruling care, we are but naught.

      from the country around, but they promptly drove them <span class="pagenum">[214]</span><a
      name="link214" id="link214"></a>back to their hiding-places. At Cross

      Guerrilla warfare is most exasperating. The West was full of these vicious
      and irresponsible men, who, under a leader of courage and brains, would
      unite to prey on and murder rich and poor alike. They could skulk in the
      depths of the woods, and dash out upon their victims, and after gratifying
      their murderous designs, they would flee to their homes and lie in
      concealment till some new exploit would reveal their lurking place.
      Probably the best organized and most reckless of these bands was led by
      Colonel John S. Mosby, whose daring deeds made his name a terror. His
      raids were remarkable for their boldness and success. He never was
      captured, although his band was thinned often by the frequent efforts on
      the part of the Federals to bring him to justice.

      &ldquo;We are ordered back to Vicksburg, to do provost duty there,&rdquo; the captain

    </p>
    <p>
      Grumbling was heard from some of the younger ones, who were anxious to be
      &ldquo;at the front,&rdquo; and to them acting as provost guards smacked too much of
      being kept in the background. The older ones heard the news with much
      satisfaction, however.

      They returned to Vicksburg, with very different emotions to those they
      felt just after the surrender of General Pemberton, and even though they
      were not welcomed, their coming insured peace and protection from the
      contentions <span class="pagenum">[216]</span><a name="link216"      id="link216"></a>without, and the rough element within. Doing post duty is

      Skirmishes were frequent, but the days of the rebellion were drawing to a
      close. The Confederates realized that the hours of the Confederacy were
      numbered, but still they struggled on. How ardently Ralph wished that
      peace would dawn. He abhorred the bloodshed that the protracted conflict
      entailed.

      Morgan, the Confederate guerrilla, had planned a bold raid across the
      Ohio, and had captured Columbia and Lebanon, Kentucky, seized two
      steamers, and, going into Indiana, had left a trail of ruin and
      destruction behind him, as he hastened toward Cincinnati, burning bridges
      and stores, tearing up railroad tracks, and plundering every one,
      irrespective of their views. How far his depredations would have been
      carried, cannot be judged, but at Buffington Ford he was pursued so
      closely that he was driven make a stand and fight. Here he was defeated,
      and, fleeing up the stream, was again attacked at New Lisbon, where he
      surrendered, and was sent to the Ohio penitentiary, but a few months later
      he dug under the walls and fled.

      The awful Battle of the Wilderness had gone down into history, with its
      record of unparalleled daring, and its list of 60,000 dead on the two
      sides, sending up a wail to Heaven. It was in this fatal battle that
      General Longstreet, of the Confederate army, received a severe wound on
      the same ground and under a similar mistake, as that which cost Stonewall
      Jackson his life, a year before The General was returning from the front,

      The Atlanta campaign, which had added to General Sherman's everlasting
      renown, had lost to the Union cause one of its bravest generals&mdash;the
      brilliant McPherson, who lost his life by venturing into the woods almost
      alone, where he was shot by the Confederates, and his horse dashed into

      The Confederate vessel Alabama, commanded by Raphael Semmes, was at
      Cherbourg, France. She had been cruising round for two years, preying upon
      American commerce. The United States man of war, Kearsarge, Captain John
      A. Winslow, lay <span class="pagenum">[219]</span><a name="link219"      id="link219"></a>off the port, expecting Semmes to come out. The latter
      sent a polite request to Winslow, asking him not to leave those waters, as
      he intended to fight him. This was exactly Captain Winslow's wish. On
      Sunday, June 19, the Alabama went out of the harbor with flying colors,
      only to be lured off eight miles from the coast, by Captain Winslow, who
      then turned and attacked the enemy.

      After the Kearsarge began the battle, the firing was terrific and her
      shots told heavily. Captain Winslow's shells cut the mizzenmast of the
      Alabama in two. The crew were half of them killed by a shell, and the
      gunners had been swept away. After an hour's battle, it was seen that the
      Alabama was sinking, her officers struck their colors, and threw the
      swords, that would no longer avail against their adversary, into the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Winslow lowered boats from his vessel to save the remaining crew
      of the Alabama, when suddenly her stern went down, her bow was tossed into
      the air and the Alabama went to the bottom, carrying nearly all the men.
      Semmes was picked up by a yacht, with forty sailors, the Kearsarge rescued
      some, and all the rest were drowned.

      The autumn had come. October had put on its gaudy dress, and the

      &ldquo;At last we are going to move again,&rdquo; said Ralph, as they gathered round
      headquarters. &ldquo;We are to report to General Howard and go with Sherman on
      his 'March to the Sea.'&rdquo;

      &ldquo;Well, it'll be a relief, for this sort of life is too much like playing
      soldier to suit me,&rdquo; a gray-haired private responded.

    <p>
      It was a light-hearted body of men who left Vicksburg that day, but when
      they reached Nashville, they were disappointed to learn that they were too
      late to join Sherman, but the Seventeenth Corps was cut off and assigned
      to General Schofield's Command, then stationed at Columbia, Tennessee. It
      was approaching winter's rigors, and General Hood had harassed the Federal
      army at all points, and was trying to persuade Sherman away from Atlanta.
      When he found he could not do so, he massed his whole strength for the
      purpose of destroying General Thomas' forces. Turning his face in the
      direction of Nashville, he met a barrier in the heavy rains which had
      fallen, rendering the roads almost impassable, and it was well into
      November before he reached Duck River, forty miles south of Nashville.

      General Schofield expected him, but Hood flanked him by crossing to the
      other shore, which led the Union general to deem it <span class="pagenum">[222]</span><a

      Quickly he retired to Franklin, where he succeeded in getting across the
      river, throwing up earthworks, and placing his artillery. The scene was a
      stirring one. General Hood forced his men up against the strong
      breastworks with a recklessness that was appalling. They were doomed, for
      the terrific onslaught of musketry and artillery cut them down so fast
      that they were piled up in heaps, dying and dead, the entire length of the
      line.
    </p>
    <p>
      The struggle at the breastworks was so fierce that it became a hot, mad
      encounter between the two armies, who fought literally, hand to hand,
      while their fire flashed in each others faces. Officers dismounted, and
      fought beside their men. The contest became so close that the standards of
      both armies were upon the earthworks at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      A ditch ran outside the works, which was filled with the Confederates, who
      could not cross it under such a blinding fire. Here they met their
      heaviest losses. The smoke from the National side was so dense, and kept
      so near to the earth, that it added to the horror of the scene by bringing
      on almost complete darkness. <span class="pagenum">[223]</span><a
      name="link223" id="link223"></a>It was one of the hardest fought battles
      of the war, and not until midnight did General Schofield order a retreat
      to Nashville, a wise move, for had he been content to remain at Franklin,
      the fortunes of the day would have been changed very essentially, for Hood
      planted all his artillery there that night, and thus, aided by General
      Forrest's cavalry, the victory of the day before would surely have been
      turned into a defeat.

      They were worn out&mdash;unable to fight longer, and so completely
      exhausted by lack of sleep that many of the men in this retreat stumbled
      and fell on their faces, and only the vigorous pricking of the bayonet by
      their companions aroused them to a sense of the danger they were in of
      being captured,&mdash;thus they were hurried along.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole strength of the army was now concentrated on the defeat of Hood.
      On the fifteenth of December General Thomas, who had been grumbled at and
      called &ldquo;slow,&rdquo; delivered a crushing blow by moving upon Hood's front and
      flank with such force that he fled precipitately toward Franklin, with
      Wilson's famous cavalry in hot pursuit.

      The morning of February 9 was cold and frosty, and as the soldiers huddled
      round the crackling fires built in the open air, they recounted tales of
      the incidents they had seen, or fought again the battles of the past four
      years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I enlisted to the end of the war,&rdquo; said Ralph. &ldquo;'When this cruel was is
      over,' I shall go home and try to be content,&rdquo; Some of his companions
      shared his feelings; to these the prospect of returning home was a
      delightful one, but others had grown so fond of this life of danger and
      peril that a return to the peaceful pursuits of home-life seemed tame and
      dull. War hardens and blunts the finer feelings, making men callous and
      indifferent to the gentler ministrations of home.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was with mixed feelings of joy and regret that the regiment embarked on
      the steamer for New Orleans. The voyage was a break in the daily life, but
      when land soldiers are penned up on board a boat there is not much r to
      break the monotony. At noon of the fourth day they laid up at a little
      landing to &ldquo;wood up.&rdquo; Not a house was to be seen, the tall trees stood up
      black and gloomy, and the dull gray sky lowered ominously over them. Glad
      to feel the earth beneath their feet, a few of the more venturesome leaped
      ashore for a &ldquo;run in the timber,&rdquo; as they expressed it, though they
      prudently kept near the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ralph was sitting on the deck when he heard the report of a rifle, and
      jumping up, he called out, &ldquo;Our men are attacked!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Instantly every man's weapon was pointed in the direction from whence came
      the sound. A poor fellow had roamed a few steps farther from his comrades
      than caution would have dictated, and had been fired upon by guerrillas,
      who were skulking behind the trees in the leafy depths of the forest.
      Another man staggered to the edge of the bank, and would have fallen
      overboard, were it not for Ralph's quick leap. He had been wounded in the
      arm, and as he was helped on board he said; &ldquo;There is a band of them up
      there in the woods.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[226]</span><a name="link226" id="link226"></a>came
      the word of command, and the bullets whistled after the fleeing band, who
      did not return the shots, however. Whether they were hit, was not known. A
      detail was sent to bring in the body of the dead soldier who had fallen
      just at the edge of the woods. This incident checked the gay spirits of
      the men, but, after all, it was one of the possibilities of war, and might
      have befallen any one there.

      They reached the city of New Orleans on the evening of February 21st, and
      encamped at a beautiful little village about eight miles below that city.
      But their stay was brief, and again they were transported across the Gulf
      to Dauphine Island, Alabama. The March weather was health-inspiring, but

      Mobile Bay was now the destined point. Crossing over to the mainland, they
      spent several days in skirmishing, it being General Grants design to
      divert the enemy's attention from his real intention, which was to attack
      and subdue Spanish Fort, before whose walls they were arrayed on the dawn
      of March 27. Bombardment began early. A dense curtain of smoke hung over
      the fort, like a pall, and after four days of vigorous assault, their guns
      were silenced, and just before the midnight hour, the works were carried,
      amid wild cheers and exultation.

      Great events were taking place while the Western army was busy. Sheridan
      and his cavalry had not been idle in the Shenandoah Valley, and at
      Waynesboro' General Custer, the intrepid, who commanded his Third
      Division, routed General Early, and took 1,500 prisoners, and every gun
      and train he had. Sheridan was not content with this victory, but he
      ruined the locks in the James River Canal, destroyed parts of the
      railroad, thus cutting off supplies, and then joined General Grant's army,
      and passed through Dinwiddie Court House with his splendid body of
      cavalry, and attacking the right flank of the Confederates at Five Forks,
      found no <span class="pagenum">[229]</span><a name="link229" id="link229"></a>difficulty
      in dislodging their cavalry, when a strong force of infantry came to their
      rescue, who in their turn routed Sheridan most unexpectedly. At once Grant
      hurried the Fifth Corps forward to his assistance, but it was noon of the
      first of April before he could get them into position.

      Bringing up his mounted force in front, who dashed forward in gallant

      Confederates. This manouver was an unpleasant surprise to the enemy, and a
      victory for the Federal side. Five Forks was held by them, and 5,000
      prisoners fell into the hands of the Union army.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following up his advantage, General Grant leveled two more forts, whose

      the latter of which the Confederate General Hill was shot.

      General Lee's flight was a sad ending to his earnest hopes and faithful
      espousal of the cause which he believed right. He was pursued closely by
      General Grant, who attacked him whenever <span class="pagenum">[231]</span><a
      name="link231" id="link231"></a>the two armies approached each other.
      These conflicts were severe and destructive, as it presented the strange
      fact of two bodies of soldiers, both skilled and brave, moving along over
      the open country, unprotected by any entrenchments, and continually
      falling upon each other with desperation. To add to the gloom of Lee's
      situation, his men were half-famished and nearly worn out.

      name="link232" id="link232"></a>who were massed in a solid line across his
      path, but this gave him no uneasiness. He advanced with confidence that he

      truce was sent out, which caused a cessation of hostilities.

      General Lee's hopes had suddenly been destroyed. He had bravely held out,
      even in the face of adverse fate, and even in March had summoned General
      Gordon, who had command of Stonewall Jackson's old corps, to a conference,
      and that general had frankly told him the hopelessness of a further
      struggle. His own admission was that his army were almost starving, he
      could not furnish men, or food, or horses, and after visiting the
      Confederate Congress at Richmond the next day, he came back almost
      heart-broken, but with no power to stay the tide of blood. The desperate
      attack on Fort Steadman and the failure of the Confederate troops to cover
      their retreat followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Grant's liberal terms which he dictated to the defeated men were a
      marvel of generosity. He merely asked that they lay down their arms and
      return to their homes, where he promised them fullest protection in all
      their rights, so long as they did not again take up arms against the
      government. He also permitted them to take their horses with them, as they
      &ldquo;would need them for plowing,&rdquo; so sure he was that the end of the terrible
      war had come, and that men would be glad to resume the peaceful pursuits
      of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two great commanders, Ulysses S. Grant and Robert E. Lee, had
      exchanged several notes relative to the surrender, and on the 9th of April
      they met at the McLean House, where the terms were made known, and the
      next day General Lee issued a farewell address to his army, whose love and
      devotion to him had proven itself in many a hard-fought field.

      ICHMOND has <span class="pagenum">[234]</span><a name="link234"      id="link234"></a>surrendered! The army of Lee has retreated! From every
      little village, and in every vast city the glad cry rang forth on that
      bright April morning, early in 1865, till the echoes bore the joyful
      tidings to every camp and bivouac in the Union army, &ldquo;Shout the glad
      tidings!&rdquo; The words rang out, and the streets of the cities were filled
      with excited crowds of men and women, who were frantic with joy. Even the
      little children seemed to have become inspired with the enthusiasm, and
      laughed and danced, they knew not why.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flags were run up in haste, men and boys ran wildly around, singing and
      cheering, strangers clasped each others' hands gladly, while women wept
      with joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;good news,&rdquo; however, had been received at first by the army to which
      Ralph belonged, with incredulity, and such expressions as &ldquo;We've heard
      that before!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My feet are pretty sore tramping!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going right on to Richmond now!&rdquo; and it chagrined the officer in
      charge so deeply to think that they could not accept it as a truth, that
      he had the men drawn up in line, some 6,000 strong, in the pine woods
      through which they were marching, and appointed officers to ride up and
      down the line and announce it officially. And then what a roar and
      thundering of cheers aroused the echoes in those old trees! No more
      weariness then, no more stumbling and grumbling, but they made all haste
      to the town to which they were nearest, and set up a playful bombardment
      with blank charges, to celebrate the event, much to the rejoicing of the
      citizens there, who were as glad as they.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the worn-out, sunburned soldiers it was good news, and as they <span
      class="pagenum">[235]</span><a name="link235" id="link235"></a>gathered in
      groups loud rejoicing and eager discussion was heard among them. To Ralph
      it brought the grateful thought that the dawn of peace was near, and the
      Union would once again be restored, and his heart was full of a quiet
      thankfulness that words could not express.
    </p>
    <p>
      But alas, for the jubilant people&mdash;for those who were rejoicing, and
      to whom a feeling of relief had come, because there was no more war. Those
      who had so bitterly opposed each other on fields of battle, whose
      differences had received a &ldquo;baptism of blood,&rdquo; met daily, more like
      brothers than late enemies. True, bitterness and disappointment rankled in
      some hearts, but it is also true that all over our broad land, both North
      and South, men rejoiced together that they could return to the homes they
      had been so long exiles from, and once more take up the thread of social
      and business life, with a surety that it would be no more severed But even
      while the North was trembling with excess of happiness, a terrible shadow
      darkened the brilliancy of the victory&mdash;the four years of struggle
      and bloodshed were obliterated, so it seemed, by a wave of sorrow that
      swept over the heart of the North, paralyzing its throb of ecstasy.
      Abraham Lincoln, the friend of all mankind, whose life was free from petty
      vindictiveness, and whose whole aim was the restoration of the republic on
      a fair and just basis, a grand and unselfish man, was struck down by the
      hand of an assassin&mdash;J. Wilkes Booth. The President was shot while
      sitting with his wife and other friends, in a box at Ford's Theater,
      Washington, April 14, 1865, and he died the next morning. The entire
      nation was dumb with grief and consternation. On the heels of sweet and
      gentle peace came the dread question&mdash;What will be the outcome? A
      nation had been plunged into mourning by the mad act of a fanatic.

      At once the War Department issued a poster, offering a large reward for
      the capture of the murderer, and on April 26 he was tracked to an old barn
      on Garrett's farm, twenty miles from Fredericksburg, with a shattered leg.
      He refused to surrender, <span class="pagenum">[237]</span><a
      name="link237" id="link237"></a>and the building was set on fire, and he
      was shot in attempting to escape, and captured. He had received a mortal
      wound, from which he died.
    </p>
    <p>
      The surrender of General Lee was followed by that of all the principal
      armies of the Confederacy; the last to throw down their arms being the
      command of General Kirby Smith, on the 26th of May. Thus very little was
      left for the Government to do, save to reconstruct the shattered portions
      of our land, to repress wandering bands of outlaws, and to maintain order.

      The close of the war was welcomed by North and South alike&mdash;it was as
      if a hideous nightmare had been banished, and now the waking dreams of
      desolated homes, reunited, could be realized.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the boys in blue who had fought valiantly and untiringly, the news that
      the opposing armies had surrendered was a relief, although they
      sorrowfully turned their faces homeward, at the remembrance of those who
      came not with them; still a deep joy filled their souls as they thought of
      those who were waiting to receive them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same scenes were transpiring at the South, where patient wives,
      mothers, sisters and daughters were waiting and watching for those who had
      been so strangely preserved to them, and happy voices and beaming smiles
      made their home-coming glad.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two armies&mdash;the Army of the Potomac and Sherman's Army&mdash;were
      sent to Washington late in May for review, before being mustered out of
      service. The scene was inspiring. The <span class="pagenum">[238]</span><a
      name="link238" id="link238"></a> streets were packed with a surging mass
      of people, proud to shout and cheer for the brown-faced men who fought for
      the upholding of their beloved government.

      Banners, garlands of flowers, tumultuous cheering, marked the marching
      divisions of the Army of the Potomac, as they wheeled into line, and
      arriving at <span class="pagenum">[240]</span><a name="link240"      id="link240"></a>the grand stand at the White House, where President
      Johnson and his cabinet reviewed them, the officers gave a royal salute
      with their swords, while the commanders of the divisions sprang from their
      horses, and went upon the stand as their commands filed by.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following day, May 24, Sherman's noble army of bronzed and
      weather-beaten men were reviewed in the same manner, and as the marching
      columns kept step to the music of their bands, the enthusiasm was intense,
      and broke into cheer after cheer, while the houses, sidewalks, and every
      spot where human beings could find a foothold, was one mass of waving
      flags, handkerchiefs and streamers.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Ralph, in far-away Montgomery, where the regiment was to remain but a
      day or so, read the account of the monster ovation, his bosom swelled with
      pride, and life seemed to, take on a rosier color. Every cheer that was
      uttered, every look of welcome to those who passed through the streets of
      Washington that day, he considered a tribute to every soldier in the land;
      for had they not all done their duty and stood by their colors?
    </p>
    <p>
      He claimed a share in that rejoicing, even though could not be there, and
      he vaguely wondered if those who had died to save this glorious Union did
      not also rejoice at the dawn of peace, and the new birth of a nation,
      whose proudest boast should ever be that &ldquo;All men are born free and
      equal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His soul went out in peace and love to all&mdash;to those who had fallen
      in battle or died of wounds on either side; to the dear comrades whom he
      remembered long; to that grana martyr&mdash;the type of freedom, justice
      and love for all&mdash;Abraham Lincoln!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dreaming, are you?&rdquo; a cheery voice broke in upon his musings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Steve, I am dreaming&mdash;dreaming of the time when I can go to my
      mother, and tell her how grateful I am that I have been saved through all
      the sad scenes the past four years have shown me.&rdquo;

      &ldquo;That's true, Steve, and I am sorry it must be so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two days later, and while the daily papers were full of the descriptions
      of the gorgeous spectacle the review furnished, they moved on to Union
      Springs. Here they found a turbulent element which only the presence of
      soldiers could quell. Remaining here until the middle of July, they had
      orders to proceed to Vicksburg, where they were to be mustered out of the
      service of the United States.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was August before they reached Vicksburg, where they were discharged
      from further service. When Ralph stepped on board the steamer which was to
      convey them to Cairo, he was overjoyed. His spirits bubbled over like a
      schoolboy's, and he mingled with the gay crowd of passengers, with a light
      heart. The water was low, and as they sailed between the banks, the sounds
      of industry were plainly to be heard, as the blacks worked in the fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they glided along, the merry throngs were amusing themselves, some in
      the cabin, dancing to the music of the piano, some chatting as pleasantly
      with the soldiers as if their acquaintance had extended over years, and
      all light-hearted and careless. A sudden commotion was heard, and the
      quick, sharp voice of the captain giving orders. Too late&mdash;a sudden
      jar, a trembling of the boat, and a crash, over all of which were heard
      shrieks of terror and the hoarse shouting of the officers, as the boat,
      with her hull completely torn away, began to settle into the muddy bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
      A huge snag, floating down stream, had caught the boat's hull, and
      completely destroyed it, and the steamer was sinking like lead.
    </p>
    <p>
      The river was alive with frightened human beings, some of whom <span
      class="pagenum">[244]</span><a name="link244" id="link244"></a>had jumped
      at the first shock, while others had been hurled into the water. Ralph was
      among the latter, and his terror was intense, as he wondered, with
      lightning-like rapidity, whether he had passed through so much danger,
      only to perish miserably just when he felt that he was safe. He was
      overcome but a moment, however, and seeing the gang plank floating a few
      yards away, he swam toward it, and seizing one end, he raised himself upon
      it and began to plan what he should do next. The cries of some were
      growing feebler. He saw men on the bank putting boats out from shore, and
      as he floated along he called loudly to those within sound of his voice,
      trying to encourage them. He caught a lady by her dress and placed her on
      his raft, then a child floated by, whose light form he grasped firmly, as
      he laid her on the planks. Thus Ralph managed, by courage and strength, to
      save fifteen persons on his clumsy but exceedingly useful craft.
    </p>
    <p>
      He paddled them to shore, and on his way he saw a young black girl who had
      been on board with her mistress. She was being drawn at a rapid pace
      through the water, by hanging to the tail of a mule, who was swimming
      vigorously to land. One moment her head would be under the water, as the
      mule went along, and the next she would come up to the surface, sputtering
      and shaking it from her streaming head, but never for an instant relaxing
      her hold of the frightened animal, who must have wondered a little why he
      was being used for a tow boat. Ralph's love of fun and the queer spectacle
      overcame him, even in the midst of danger, and as she went by, he asked
      her how she was getting along.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fust rate, massa. We'll make de passage, I 'low, sooner dan yo' crew
      will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All the passengers were saved, and those who owed their rescue to Ralph's
      courage, would have made him the hero of the hour, but he modestly
      disclaimed any praise, for it was by mere luck, he said, that the
      gang-plank came his way, and any one would have done as much, or even
      more. <span class="pagenum">[245]</span><a name="link245" id="link245"></a>

      A <span class="pagenum">[246]</span><a name="link246" id="link246"></a>gunboat
      was sent to take them up the river, and soon the placid scenery of the
      Mississippi was exchanged for the ripe fields, the well-tilled farms of
      Illinois, as they were whirled on the train toward Chicago. The sun poured
      down his hottest beams, the skies were sultry, and the pavements hot and
      dusty, when they reached that city, but a reception awaited them, which
      made the heat and dust seem trifles, as they marched through the lines of
      people who greeted them on their return from the war. And as the battle
      flags were borne aloft, some mere tattered rags, some with blood dyed
      folds, carried by maimed and scarred veterans, whose eagle eyes scanned
      the throngs to find some one whom they knew and who would clasp them by
      the hand as in the olden time, there was not a man in those thinned ranks
      but thanked his heavenly Father that once more he trod the soil of a clime
      where peace folded her snowy wings, and the sounds of war and discord were
      heard no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the train rolled into the depot, Ralph heard the shouts and cheers
      going up for the boys in blue, and a six-pounder was fired off, giving
      them a salute of thirty-six guns. He felt proud to belong to that stalwart
      band of men who had borne the brunt of the battle, and whose hands had
      helped to rear the massive structure of a reunited nation upon an enduring
      base&mdash;freedom for all. And then cheers broke forth from thousands of
      throats, women's faces grew brighter, children caught the contagion of
      joy, and men shouted v and hurrahed until they were hoarse. The boys had
      come home from the war, and their toil and privations were past. Never
      again, it was to be hoped, should the wave of dissension sweep across the
      land, but the banner of liberty should float from every tower and dome,
      for all nations to honor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The soldiers had caught the glad spirit of welcome, and as they wheeled
      into line and kept step to the music of their bands, every nerve tingled
      and burned, and their hearts beat tumultuously. They were to be shown
      still farther attention, for they were escorted to a hall, <span
      class="pagenum">[247]</span><a name="link247" id="link247"></a>where, when
      they had &ldquo;stacked arms,&rdquo; they clasped hands with old friends, and after a
      half hour passed in renewing old friendships and making new, they were
      invited to an elegant banquet, to which they all did justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Ralph the scene was a revelation&mdash;the brightly lit hall, the
      perfume of countless flowers, the kind attentions of beautiful women, and
      the eloquent speeches&mdash;all in turn charmed him, and the home-coming
      seemed, indeed, a delightful fairy vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there were yet three weary days of waiting ere the final forms were
      gone through with, the regiment paid off, the Board of Trade having
      assumed the payment, so as to permit the men to return home more speedily,
      and to Ralph they were the longest and most tedious he ever remembered.
      But at last his face was turned homeward, and as he sprang from the car,
      and hurried along the one short mile that divided the dear mother from
      him, his sunburned and speaking face, the erect form and swinging, elastic
      step, bore no resemblance to the boy who had come home to die, two years
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother and sisters stood in the doorway, and as they threw their arms
      around him, and pressed him to their hearts, he knew at last the sweet and
      tender bliss those two simple words conveyed&mdash;&ldquo;Home again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And when, in the years that followed, the simple army boy rose to position
      and fame in the field he chose for a life-calling, his dearest memories
      were of the toil and pain and sacrifice of the days he spent in the army.
      His proudest boast was that, humble as were his services, obscure as he
      was, he gave all he had, youth, energy, enthusiasm and endurance, to the
      cause of universal freedom, and dearly as he loved his mother and home, he
      still more dearly loved the land of his birth.

    <h2>
      THE SANITARY COMMISSION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I want to tell the boys and girls who have followed Ralph's simple story
      to the end of the war, about a grand body of men and women who worked
      valiantly for the soldiers while they were fighting in the field. Indeed,
      it would be unjust to the wives, mothers <span class="pagenum">[248]</span><a
      name="link248" id="link248"></a>and sisters of the boys of the days of the
      war, did I not say something about this noble enterprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been said that women cannot fight, but even that assertion is not
      strictly true, for the records of history have furnished many cases of
      women going to the front with their husbands, disguised as men. But though
      they did not help swell the quota of soldiers, they did noble deeds&mdash;they
      cheered and comforted the boys in the field, and took tender care of them
      when sick or hungry. And one of the most powerful outgrowths of this
      humane and womanly sympathy was the Sanitary Commission.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the war broke out, in 1861, the women of the North met at once in
      many places to confer with each other as to the best means for taking
      proper care of the sick and wounded. They commenced to form societies, and
      chief among their objects was the wise one of bringing the sick home
      wherever it was possible, purchasing warm clothes, provisions and little
      additions to their comfort which the Government could not supply, the
      sending of books and papers to the camps, and keeping informed as to the
      condition and needs of the soldiers, by corresponding with officers of
      regiments, thus learning all they could about individuals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such efforts were lofty and patriotic, and coming to the notice of Dr.
      Henry Bellows and Dr. Elisha Harris, they talked the matter over, and
      proposed to call a meeting, to get things into shape. They saw the value
      of the aid which women could give, so selecting Cooper Union. New York
      City, for a gathering-place, they invited all the societies of women whose
      aims were similar to meet with them, and this hall, one of the largest at
      that time, could scarce contain those who came, so earnest was the
      interest taken in the matter. A permanent association was formed, and a
      constitution was framed by Dr. Bellows.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">[249]</span><a name="link249" id="link249"></a>

    <p>
      The next step they took was to send a committee to Washington, offering
      the Government their services. General Scott received it kindly, but did
      not see that it was right to give the members <span class="pagenum">[250]</span><a
      name="link250" id="link250"></a>any authority. But they were not
      discouraged, though it is sad to say that the first days of the Commission
      were very dark, for they found army officials full of jealousy, for they
      could not see that anything which could be practical and useful could
      exist outside of the regulations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Government itself had just gone through the hard task of making
      matters straight between the regular army and the volunteer, and very
      naturally dreaded any further agitation, or the opening up of any new
      topic. But after trying so hard to accomplish something, they were glad of
      even the permission given them to form a commission, which should consult
      with the government as to the sanitary condition of the people. This was a
      small concession, but it was the beginning of an immense undertaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, they were distrusted and suspected, and at this unfortunate
      juncture, their friend, Surgeon-General Lawson, died, and was succeeded by
      Dr. Clement Finley, who was bitterly opposed to the movement. Another long
      struggle ensued, which was ended by permission being given them to form a
      commission that should act only in connection with officers of the
      volunteer army, and have no authority whatever. This was permitting them
      to do good only on their own responsibility. Even Mr. Lincoln, whose heart
      was ever in the right place, seemed to consider their plans and aims as of
      small account, but he, with Secretary of War Simon Cameron, yielded, and
      the association was, on June 13, 1861, made real.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of its first steps was to obtain the discharge of boys (of whom there
      were a large number in the army) who were too young for hard service, and
      sickly men who had been mustered in through careless and hasty
      examinations.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this time the Commission grew, until it had so many, avenues of
      usefulness that it became too vast to attempt to carry out its designs
      under one head, and so women everywhere were called upon to help in the
      great work by forming local societies, to carry on their labors. More than
      7,000 such sprang into <span class="pagenum">[251]</span><a name="link251"      id="link251"></a>existence, all of whom raised supplies of food and
      clothes and money to bestow on the brave boys in hospital and field. It is
      estimated that in the course of the war the Sanitary Commission provided
      4,500,000 meals for sick and hungry soldiers. They also had ambulances,
      and were often found on the field with supplies, and at the very front,
      rescuing those who were wounded. It had hospitals and depots for the
      objects of its care. It had camps for soldiers who were convalescent, and
      not only looked after the physical needs of the boys in blue, but in
      connection with the Young Men's Christian Association measures were taken
      looking to their souls' needs, also, and religious reading matter was
      given them, prayers and addresses were had at the recruiting offices, and
      a hymn book was compiled, which seemed to be exactly what a soldier
      needed.

      The Sanitary Commission had a ready assistant in the Christian Commission,
      which came into existence as a working body on November 14, 1861. These
      two organizations worked harmoniously together, and it can never be told
      how much good they did.

      Among the many women who gave their whole strength with sincerity, we have
      space for but a few names, although the list might lengthen out
      indefinitely, for to woman is due the credit of unselfishness and
      patriotism and earnestness in whatever project she engages. She never
      gives her efforts grudgingly, but puts her whole soul forth. The women of
      the North and of the South gave all they had&mdash;-their dear ones whose
      going away clouded the light of home, their services in ministering to the
      sick, their patient skill in furnishing articles for their personal use.
      All these things women did for the cause, and much more.

      Miss Taylor was born in New York, but lived at the breaking out of the war
      in <span class="pagenum">[252]</span><a name="link252" id="link252"></a>New
      Orleans. She was ever ready to work in the hospitals, and gave liberally

      It is told of her that it was well known that she loved the old flag, and
      this caused bitter feelings, a mob once even surrounding her house, and
      demanding to know her sentiments. She was watching her dying husband. They
      gave her five minutes to say whether she was for the North or South, and
      threatened her that if she was for the North, they would tear down her
      house. Her brave answer was, that she was and ever should be, &ldquo;Tear my
      house down if you choose!&rdquo; she said To their honor, be it said, although
      very angry with her, they dispersed without doing her any injury.

      A young lady who volunteered as a nurse just after the first battle of
      Bull Run was Miss Hattie A. Dada, also of New York. She worked incessantly
      through the entire war, part of the time in the Eastern and part in the
      Western armies. She was taken prisoner by the Confederates after the
      retreat of General Banks in the Shenandoah Valley, and was held three
      months. After her release she spent two years in the hospitals at
      Murfreesboro, a very arduous field of labor.

      There were many other opportunities for women to work in the cause. Bazars
      were held, materials were solicited and manufactured for sale, speeches
      were made, arousing patriotic sentiments, and societies were formed to
      assist formed to assist the families of soldiers. There was no end to the
      calls for kindly offices.

      Among the foremost of those who turned their talents to this use, was Mrs.

      Perhaps no woman's name is so widely known, after Florence Nightingale's,
      of the Old World, as having labored long and unceasingly in the cause of
      humanity, as is that of Clara Barton. Her arduous services in field and
      hospital, her untiring devotion to the welfare of the soldier, her efforts
      to find the dead and missing, so as to send word to their kindred, her
      weary search in Southern prisons for news of the absent, and her formation
      of a corps of nurses to work for the helpless in the present war, have
      endeared her to every humane heart in our land. She knows no distinction&mdash;all
      are alike the objects of her bounteous care. And when the names of those
      who love their kind go down into history, Clara Barton's will be honored
      and revered among the first killed at Cold Harbor; it unnerved her so that
      her own death followed soon, and on the 27th of July, 1864, she passed
      away to a heavenly shore.

      Breckenridge, a relative of the celebrated Breckenridge family of

      illness. Her pure face and lovely manners made the boys regard and call
      her &ldquo;The Angel.&rdquo; She was very ill, but determined to continue her &ldquo;labor
      of love,&rdquo; when the death of her brother-in-law, Colonel Porter, who was
      who <span class="pagenum">[257]</span><a name="link257" id="link257"></a>did
      effective work as spies, for the cause they espoused. Among the most noted
      of these was Pauline Cushman, a Union spy, who was wounded twice while in
      the service, and was made a major by General Garfield, and Belle Boyd, who
      was famous throughout the war as one of the most daring and successful

      The life of spies is one of incessant danger, and demands rare qualities

      Peace had come to our land, but the man whose splendid generalship had won
      it for us, was seized with a painful affection of the throat, which soon

      He was an agonized but patient and uncomplaining sufferer, and during all
      his illness he worked laboriously at his &ldquo;Memoirs,&rdquo; which he had
      undertaken to write for publication, and finished them but four days
      before he died. He had passed through a long year of pain and anguish,
      ended only by his death, which took place at Mt. McGregor, near Saratoga,
      New York, July 23, 1885.

      His funeral was probably the most imposing ever accorded to a <span

      the hero; it was completed, and General Grant's remains were removed to

      with magnificent ceremonies. The celebration occurred on the recurrence of
      his birthday, he having been born at Point Pleasant, Ohio, on April 27,
      1822. His tomb stands on a height of land at the north end of Riverside
      Park, New York City, where a fine view of the beautiful Hudson is had, and

      a blessed thought that, though they have gone hence, and their battle cry
      sweeps no more like a whirlwind in the faces of the enemy, yet the sacred
      anniversary brings back the memory of their heroic deeds, and as the bands
      of music peal out in solemn strains, and the tongues of orators are heard,
      recounting the story that will never grow old, the heart is stirred by a
      tender love for them, and goes out to the dead of the army who wore the
      gray as well. They were dear to their friends, among their most precious
      possessions, who mourn them deeply yet. The boys in gray laid down their

      Memorial Day has become what its name signifies&mdash;a mingling of the
      friends of the Blue and the Gray, and a cordial exchange of mutual
      courtesies. The graves of both are decked in unison in many of the
      resting-places of the nation's soldier dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thought of decorating the graves of their dead comrades originated
      with the Grand Army men, and they inaugurated the custom on May 30, 1868.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let this hallowed duty be observed in every graveyard of our land. And
      when the blossoms of beauty are borne to their resting-places, scatter
      them with lavish hands over the men who wore the Blue and the Gray, alike.
      They are slumbering peacefully under the green sward, and the sounds of
      conflict will disturb them no more. As we stand at their graves, let
      gentle thoughts of love and sympathy drive forever away all harsh or
      bitter memories. Let us think of them as having finished the battle&mdash;it
      is over, and they have gone to their reward.

    <p class="indent10">
      Like men we did our duty
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      When screaming bullets flew.
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Four years we fought like devils,

    <p class="indent10">
      Your hand met mine in friendly clasp

    <p class="indent15">
      Our two hearts beat as one.

    <p class="indent10">
      And now when danger threatens,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      No North, no South, we know;
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Once more we stand together
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      To fight the common foe.

    <p class="indent10">
      My head, like yours, is frosty&mdash;

    <p class="indent15">
      Old age is creeping on;

      HE <span class="pagenum">[265]</span><a name="link265" id="link265"></a>night
      had fallen slowly and softly. The stars had stolen out, now dancing gaily
      in one corner of the heavens, and now a cluster of them marched forth in
      stately fashion. The air was quiet; even the leaves had quit whispering,
      the breeze had died away, and they nodded sleepily on their stems. Pretty
      Alice Whiting sat on the porch of the one-story, old style plantation
      house, and lazily wished the tea-table, whose disorder showed it had been
      attacked by hungry mouths, would vanish bodily. But it didn't, and she
      ruefully contemplated the prospect of clearing it up herself, with much
      chagrin, for such lovely nights, she declared, were not made to work in.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had come to Memphis from the North with her husband and brother, who
      had &ldquo;settled&rdquo; in that hospitable city. Frank and Will had gone to the
      lodge, and she had been dreaming of her far Northern home. As she sat
      there her head rested against the vines which covered the porch, turning
      it into a perfect bower of beauty. Her dark brown hair waved and curled
      around a broad, full forehead; her features were far from regular, but the
      piquant nose and smiling mouth redeemed them, and gave a saucy charm which
      was more pleasing than set beauty. And as the moon rose in the sky, until
      her pale beams lit up the darkened porch, flooding every corner, she made
      as pretty a picture as one would wish to look upon. Something of this
      thought evidently passed through the mind of the man who had stolen
      noiselessly through the garden until he stood by her side, for he looked
      earnestly upon her as if loth to disturb her, and then longingly at the
      table, which had abundance, even after the appetites of the household had
      been appeased.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a start she sprang to her feet. Her heart beat loud and <span
      class="pagenum">[266]</span><a name="link266" id="link266"></a>rapid with
      fear, as she looked at the stranger. Visions of burglars, guerrillas and
      all the clan, flitted through her brain, and held her dumb, unable to
      utter a sound, from pure terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly the man before her was not one to reassure her, for he was
      wild-eyed and dirty, and his ragged clothes had fallen away from his thin
      frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be afraid, ma'am,&rdquo; he said, in a voice intended to be gentle and
      assuring; &ldquo;all I ask is a bite to eat. I'd never hurt a woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew a quick breath of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you hungry?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hungry? Look at me, ma'am. Do you see any signs of the gourmand about
      me?&rdquo; pointing to his pinched face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll give you something to eat&mdash;for Eddie's dear sake,&rdquo; she added,
      in a faint whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bringing clean dishes, she poured out a cup of coffee, and bade him sit
      down and help himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I have a wash fust?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and welcome.&rdquo; Bringing him a basin of clear cold water and a towel,
      she had the pleasure of seeing some of the tawny hue disappear, and he
      seated himself and began to eat most heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was just after the war, and the city was full of homeless men, who
      roamed its streets, unable to find work, and actually living on charity.
      Some of them had no home to go to, and others could not raise the means to
      take them there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pears like we wus whipped bad,&rdquo; he said, between the mouthfuls.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded an affirmative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I 'lowed General Forrest would help me to get back to Georgy. There's
      whar I belong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ask him?&rdquo; The General was a resident of Memphis at that time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went to see him about it, and he couldn't do nothing&mdash;said he had
      no money,&rdquo; which was a fact, no doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <span class="pagenum">[267]</span><a name="link267" id="link267"></a>tell
      you, them cussed Yanks fit well. They had good pluck, after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think they proved that,&rdquo; she said faintly, her terror returning, for
      she saw he thought her a Southerner as well as himself, and she had misty
      visions of being strangled, the silly girl. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;will Frank
      never come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man ate as if he had not seen food for many a day, and all the time
      his discourse was about the Yanks and what he'd like to do to' them. At
      last his hunger seemed satisfied, and rising, with his ragged, faded
      soldier cap in hand, he began to thank her profusely for her kindness.
      Something in her face arrested his attention, for he suddenly paused, and
      coming a step nearer to her, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't like to beg, but I was nigh dead. If those Northern cusses
      hadn't beaten us into poverty, I'd have been home with my old mother now.
      I don't 'low they'd ever give a crust to a dog to keep life in his body!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her face flushed, and a sudden courage came to her. She answered,
      defiantly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, you do not do us justice. You do not know us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Know you? Ain't you one of our people, ma'am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am one of those people you despise&mdash;a Yankee,&rdquo; she answered,
      looking him steadily in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Yankee? And you have fed <i>me</i>. Fed a man who has been abusing you
      right along, and you must hate him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not hate you. Oh, no, I could not hate a single human being. You are
      one of God's children, and so am I.&rdquo; The scowl of doubt and distrust fled
      from the man's troubled face. He towered above her, tall, gaunt, but
      powerfully built.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it seems strange you'd be so willing to help me out, when you knew
      that I was agin your kind. Why did you do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were hungry, and asked me for food. I have a better reason than that,
      even. I am but a girl, but I had a little brother younger than I, the idol
      of our home, who went to war, as a bugler. He was so frail and boyish that
      they wouldn't enlist him as an able-bodied soldier, but he would go. He
      was wounded <span class="pagenum">[268]</span><a name="link268"      id="link268"></a>and taken prisoner in the Battle of the Wilderness,
      carried to Andersonville, where he died. I made a solemn promise to my own
      heart that never, while life lasted, would a human being ask me for food
      in vain, even though I took the food from my own lips to give him. I will
      keep my word. You are welcome to all I have given you. May you never
      want.&rdquo; The man looked down at her, and in a choked voice said: &ldquo;Ma'am, may
      I take you by the hand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She held out both hands toward him, and as he grasped them and reverently
      bent over them, a tear dropped on their whiteness, and he walked quickly
      away into the silence and darkness of the night.

      T <span class="pagenum">[269]</span><a name="link269" id="link269"></a>was
      the autumn of 1864, and the supplies for the boys in blue were being
      hurried forward. The Government purchased cattle in the North and West,
      and sent them to its soldiers, for they must be fed or they could not
      fight. The Southern army had not fared so well&mdash;they were destitute
      of nearly everything. Foraging had been kept up the troops on both sides,
      until the land was almost devastated. Families were suffering from hunger,
      for most of the able-bodied men were at the front, and only old men and
      pretended farmers remained to till the land. These latter belonged to the
      roving bands of guerrillas who pretended to work the farm lands. Want
      stared women and children in the face. Little ones who could not
      understand the dreadful fever of hate and blood that was abroad in the
      land looked into the faces of their elders, and asked for food.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thomas Grant was a young fellow of nineteen who had seen some service in
      the Missouri militia, and was full of life and youth. His early days had
      been spent on a farm in Northern New York, where his reckless courage and
      fine horsemanship had made him a leader among his boy comrades. When he
      entered the Government service it was for the purpose of driving cattle to
      the army for its use.
    </p>
    <p>
      The position was one of great danger. Their steps were watched by
      guerrillas by night and by day, and many a stray shot <span class="pagenum">[270]</span><a
      name="link270" id="link270"></a>picked off a cattle driver or one of the
      soldiers who accompanied them as guards. Hurrying them over hill and dale,
      now in dense woods, and now over country roads, sometimes struggling and
      sticking in the clayey beds, it was a common event to have many of the
      tired animals, worn and footsore, fall down in their tracks, to be
      abandoned. These animals were a rich harvest for the guerrillas who
      hovered in their wake, like birds of prey, for they would capture the
      weary beasts, and convert them into food. It was the pride of a cattle
      driver when he could bring the bulk of his drove to the destined point,
      and deliver them to the quartermaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was sultry, and the dust lay in heaps along the highway. The news had
      come that a large body of Confederate cavalry were about to attack
      Stevenson, Alabama, which was held by the Union forces, and the cattle
      were hurried out of the town as soon as the first beams of the morning sun
      lighted up the earth. The boom of cannon and the rattle of musketry lent
      wings to their going.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The rebs are after us, and we'll lose every steer we have,&rdquo; the foreman
      said to Tom Grant, who rode beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning breeze brought the scent of the wild flowers on its wings, and
      as the soldiers guarding the train marched with easy, swinging step, it
      seemed more like a lively walk taken for pleasure than a dangerous
      undertaking. The hills ahead were clothed in a beautiful green, sprinkled
      thickly with the white clover so dear to the bovine tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll get away all right, Tom,&rdquo; said the foreman, Jim Morrison. &ldquo;But we
      must make quicker time than this. Our usual twelve miles a day ain't going
      to bring us out of the reach of the Johnnies, and before we get far they'd
      overtake us, and then good-bye to the steers, and to our own liberty as
      well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's trouble ahead already,&rdquo; Tom replied. He was active and lithe, and
      ever on the alert, showing much skill in managing cattle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blast that long-horned steer,&rdquo; Cleary, the assistant foreman, cried.
      &ldquo;They're on the stampede. Boys, go after them, lively.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A <span class="pagenum">[271]</span><a name="link271" id="link271"></a>score
      of drivers set spurs to their horses, while the frightened animals, with
      tremendous leaps, thundered across an open field, and made straightway for
      a gully just beyond the field. The scene was one of wild confusion. The
      shouts and oaths of the drivers, the trampling and crowding of the
      maddened creatures, as they tore over the grassy field, and the sounds of
      the firing behind them, in the beleaguered town, were indescribable.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Morrison and Tom Grant spurred their horses toward the flying cattle,
      intending to head them off, but Tom's horse was fleet, and coming up to
      the leading steer, he threw the whole force of his horse's breast against
      the steer's neck, and vigorously plying the whip to its nose, he checked
      its headlong career, and drew him into a circle. At once the remainder of
      the drove followed their leader, and quiet was restored. The unreasoning
      animals, governed only by instinct, were soon started on their original
      course.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lieutenant in charge of the drove complimented young Tom in the
      warmest terms, stating that he had accomplished more than any ten men.
    </p>
    <p>
      The journey was finished without any further incident. They made such good
      time that they escaped capture at the hands of the Confederates, and on
      arriving at Chattanooga, Lieutenant Reed was promoted to the charge of a
      drove of 3,000. This honor he knew was due principally to the ability and
      quickness of manouver which Tom Grant had exhibited, and to show his
      gratitude he had the boy appointed to the superintendence of the drove, a
      position which many an older man coveted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Days passed slowly by; the cattle, many of them, grew restive and
      footsore. Often one or two would lie down, and then it was impossible to
      get them up again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did that little black cow come from?&rdquo; one of the men asked,
      pointing to a cow walking sedately along in the drove.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose she's wandered in from some farm place we've passed on the
      way,&rdquo; Tom Grant said. &ldquo;But anyhow she's a godsend, for we'll have fresh
      milk now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you milk?&rdquo; the Lieutenant asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I? <span class="pagenum">[272]</span><a name="link272" id="link272"></a>What
      was I brought up on a farm for, I wonder!&rdquo; Tom responded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're a regular encyclopaedia, Tom,&rdquo; the officer laughed. &ldquo;But, of
      course, the cream comes to headquarters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly&mdash;but what shall I raise it in, my hat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll fix that. On second thoughts, think I'll take the cream with the
      milk&mdash;just whenever I can get it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little creature was as smooth as satin, and quite plump. To Tom's
      charge she fell, and he milked her each day as he promised he would, and
      she soon became known as &ldquo;Tom's cow.&rdquo;' She seemed quite at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      One hot and sultry day, when they had traveled with considerable speed,
      Tom's prize showed signs of exhaustion. At last she could go no farther,
      but lay down, hot, tired and footsore, at a cross roads.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'd better let her rest and then we'll come back after her,&rdquo; Jim Cleary
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the best thing we can do, I believe.&rdquo; So the animal was left where
      she had dropped, and the drove kept on till they found a place where they
      could feed and rest for the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as it began to grow dark Tom and his companion started back to
      where they had left the cow. She was not there, but a woman sitting
      outside of quite a pretentious, two-story house, informed them that a man
      who lived &ldquo;down the cross road a piece&rdquo; had driven her to his own home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll have to get her back, Tom, for she's quite an acquisition to our
      larder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was quite dark when they reached the place to which they had been
      directed. It was a weather-beaten old log house, with one room down stairs
      to serve the family, and an attic or loft above. Rapping at the door, they
      heard a gruff voice bid them enter. By the dim light of a sputtering
      candle they saw a rough, poorly dressed man and a woman sitting at a table
      which had no cloth, on which was some corn bread and sorghum. The mother
      held a puny, sickly little girl in her arms, whose big <span
      class="pagenum">[273]</span><a name="link273" id="link273"></a>eyes roved
      restlessly around, as if wondering who the strangers were. A tin cup stood
      by her plate, full of milk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strangers, what ar' yer business?&rdquo; The man's threatening countenance
      seemed to demand an instant reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are looking for a cow we've lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wall, what's that to me? Yer didn't expect to find it here in this cabin,
      did ye?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exactly in the cabin, but we heard it was down here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wall, that's about so, but I found the critter lying down in the bottoms,
      and I concluded she was as much mine as any one's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That ain't so, for we own the cow; that is to say, she joined our drove
      of cattle we are taking to the army, and so we have the first claim on
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man seemed to be listening. He paused a moment, and looked furtively
      around, and then at the two armed men. He went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd not have troubled it, only for the sake of my little un there. She's
      sick, and can't eat a thing. She'll die soon without some nourishment,&rdquo;
       and he pointed toward the child, who was the picture of starvation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom's heart was tender. He saw the man had not overstated the case, and he
      rose to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Jim,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;You can see the child needs that milk bad&mdash;worse
      than we do. Mister,&rdquo; he said, turning to the man, &ldquo;you are welcome to the
      cow, on one condition; and that is, that you promise on your word as a
      father that the little girl may have all the milk she can drink, every
      day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman had not spoken till now, but with a glad look she started to her
      feet, and pressing the child into its father's arms, she said&mdash;&ldquo;Jack,
      that's a fair bargain. And you're a fair man, sir, after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man looked at Tom, then out of the window, and said&mdash;&ldquo;Look here,
      young fellow, you've, shown you've got a heart, and I won't be beat in
      doing the fair thing, by any one. This neighborhood is full of fellows who
      wouldn't mind giving you a chance <span class="pagenum">[274]</span><a
      name="link274" id="link274"></a>shot. The woman up at the big house has
      given them the word that you're here, and before you know it, there'll be
      a committee sent to wait upon you. Don't go back the same road you came,
      but strike for that piece of woods, and then cut across the fields, and
      you may get away. Hurry&mdash;you haven't much time before you&mdash;you
      know the rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Into their saddles the two men vaulted, after thanking the man for his
      caution, and away they dashed. The stars were out in full force, and the
      darkness of an hour before had lifted, for the moon was rising, and as
      they entered the woods their shade hid them from sight. They rode fast
      through them, and struck a corduroy road, a rarity in that part of the
      country, and as they left it behind them, and were going to take the
      field, Jim whispered&mdash;&ldquo;Don't stir a step. Pull your horse into that
      thicket. Over there I hear them after us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They could hear the horses galloping down the road they had just left, and
      by the faint light could see that there was a dozen or more men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A narrow escape for us,&rdquo; said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We haven't escaped yet. They'll not let us get off without scouring these
      woods.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which way shall we go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, away from this vicinity as quick as we can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Kentucky thoroughbred will carry me out of danger&mdash;she can outrun
      anything they've got.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I've only got a long, lank, rangy old mule, and half-blind at that.
      I'm destined to be captured,&rdquo; ruefully answered Jim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, we're not&mdash;they are turning off into the left hand road; no,
      there's three or four taking the other one. Some have dismounted, and are
      talking with the man we've just left. He's true blue; he's pointing away
      in another direction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he's not so bad after all, even if he is a guerrilla.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, do you believe he's one of that band?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure as preaching he belongs to the gang who are bothering the whole
      country round here, and all that saved us was your generosity <span
      class="pagenum">[275]</span><a name="link275" id="link275"></a>in making
      him welcome to the little black cow. He's got a heart hid away somewhere,
      and you just touched it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom's eyes opened wide. &ldquo;I couldn't see that little creature starving
      there, and not offer them something to help her out. Why, she was nothing
      but skin and bones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We mustn't loiter here. It is a good three miles to camp, and we must
      make it quick, or they'll head us off before we reach the road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Touching their animals lightly with their spurs, they dashed across the
      open field toward another road, and were almost ready to congratulate
      themselves on their escape, when they heard a yell, and looking back they
      saw one of the guerrillas who had sighted them and was almost standing in
      his stirrups in his excitement, and shouting wildly to his companions, who
      were coming after him at full gallop. Tom and Jim did not need any further
      hint, but led the way, at a rattling pace. Tom was mounted on a racer, but
      Jim's army mule proved that he could run, for he kept pace with the horse,
      almost neck and neck. Whether he dreaded capture and being set to work, or
      feared being converted into mule meat, we are not able to say, but he held
      his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      With shouts and oaths that were heard by the two men with distinctness,
      the guerrillas dashed after them, while they kept on with break-neck
      speed, now through a gully, then over a broken fence, and sinking in the
      furrows of fields that had been plowed in the long ago, now past a ruined
      building that rose up black and forbidding in the weird moonbeams, and
      then the lights gleamed friendly from one that was occupied. What the end
      of this John Gilpin ride would have been, it is hard to say, for the
      guerrillas were gaining on them, but at a turn in the road a dozen
      blue-coats were seen coming toward them. The pursuing foe fired a few wild
      shots, which were returned with a will, when they wheeled about and fled
      across the field, and were soon in hiding in the woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom's cow came near getting me into trouble,&rdquo; Jim Cleary said, when he
      finished telling the story to the lieutenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few <span class="pagenum">[276]</span><a name="link276" id="link276"></a>weeks
      later, when they had reached Knoxville and gone into camp, an old,
      feeble-looking farmer came into the lines looking for Tom Grant. His hair
      was grizzled, and his beard uncut, and as Tom came toward him, he was
      surprised to see the wrinkled brown hand extended as if to clasp that of
      an old friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't seem to recognize me,&rdquo; the man said awkwardly. &ldquo;You haven't
      forgotten the little sick gal and her mammy down in the country a hundred
      miles or so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're not the man who showed us so much kindness when you knew the
      guerrillas were on our track?&rdquo; Tom asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The very same. You see a gray wig and a butternut suit make quite a
      farmer outen me. I'll never forget you, stranger, nor how you saved my
      baby. She was the only gal we had left&mdash;we'd lost three, and when she
      took to that milk so, and you told me to keep the cow, why, I couldn't
      hold still. I'd had it in my heart to kill you both, that night. I had
      only to whistle and I'd have brought the whole band about your ears. The
      little gal&mdash;Eda, we call her&mdash;began to pick right up on that
      milk, and now she's as peart as any child you ever saw. My woman says to
      me&mdash;'Martin, go and tell that young fellow the good turn he has done
      us.' I've followed your trail for nearly a hundred mile to tell you that
      you will never be forgotten in our home, and I'll never raise a gun
      against a Yank again.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[277]</span><a name="link277"      id="link277"></a>

    <p>
      HEN <span class="pagenum">[278]</span><a name="link278" id="link278"></a>the
      war broke out, Helen and Marie Mason, twin sisters, were left at home with
      no protector save two old slaves, Dan and Lois. Their father had given
      every dollar he had to the cause of the South. The two girls had grown up
      without a mother's care, for she had died when they were ten years old,
      and their father had mourned her so deeply that he had never thought of
      giving them a new mother. But they were not spoiled&mdash;they lived in
      this simple little home, tenderly guarded by their father, and all their
      needs had been carefully looked after by the two old slaves, who would
      have laid down their lives for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when in the second year of the war, Mr. Mason went into the army,
      their hearts were nearly broken. They declared they could not spare him,
      the &ldquo;old darling.&rdquo; Were there not plenty of younger and stronger men? and
      besides, they were half Union at heart, and did not share their father's
      sentiments of fidelity to the Southern cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      They showed no signs of their sorrow at the parting, but, with Spartan
      endurance, bade him a long farewell, and he set off, followed by the
      prayers of his beautiful daughters. Letters and messages came often to the
      little home by the Mississippi, and time did not hang quite as heavily as
      they had feared it would; but their father's letters were filled with
      bitter rancor, and he sought earnestly to impress upon their minds the
      enmity which <span class="pagenum">[279]</span><a name="link279"      id="link279"></a>they should cultivate as daughters of the sunny South,
      against the soldiers of the North.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was one chapter in their life which he had not fully conned.
      Marie would sigh deeply over her father's messages, but Helen, who had
      more independence and self-reliance, found words of consolation for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the days before the war, their home had been the scene of many a
      pleasant gathering, and among their guests were several young men of
      Northern birth, whom business or pleasure had brought to the South, and
      who had found great attractions within their charmed circle. Marie did not
      know why she took such pleasure in the coming of Walter Ryder, or why she
      felt so lonely when he was away. Her father had liked the young man for
      his manly, straightforward bearing and honest principles, but he could not
      tolerate his becoming a Union soldier, and when he learned of his
      intention, he forbade his gentle Marie ever to see him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      In vain Walter had striven to see her, if only for an instant, so that he
      might say good-bye to her. She would not disobey her father, and yet it
      was with a bitter pang that she refused to meet him once more before his
      departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Aunt Lois saw how her lily drooped, but she had great faith in her
      master's judgment, and she didn't &ldquo;like Northerners nohow,&rdquo; and yet she
      wiped many a tear away with the corner of her blue-checked apron, as she
      lamented about &ldquo;diswah dat upset eberybody's 'pinions so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Walter had gone without a word to cheer him. He had gone from the place
      which had grown so dear, and while pretty Marie wept, Helen chided her for
      her lack of fortitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      The months went by, and they often heard through returned soldiers of
      Walter Ryder. Then came news that he was wounded, and then that he had
      died of his wound. The whole world seemed to have stopped then for poor
      Marie. She grew thin and white, and she reproached herself incessantly
      because she had so cruelly refused to see Walter. The house grew strangely
      still, <span class="pagenum">[280]</span><a name="link280" id="link280"></a>for
      there were no more social meetings, and Helen shared the gloom that
      enveloped Marie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pears to me dat eberyting goes wrong,&rdquo; Aunt Lois said, as she stopped in
      her mixing bread, and gazed out upon the landscape, which was beautiful to
      look upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Aunt Lois was no poet or artist, only the colored cook in this lovely
      home. &ldquo;Fust de wall cum&mdash;den Massa Mason brung home to die, and
      pretty Missie Helen sitting dar in her bodoor all alone all day, neber
      speaking a word to po' Miss Marie, who lubed her father dearly. Don't I
      know dat po' little gal is breaking her heart 'tween losing dat foolish
      man and her dear father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lois&mdash;Aunt Lois!&rdquo; a sweet and girlish voice called.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, honey&mdash;Ise coming!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before she could take her hands from the dough a slender young girl, whose
      pure face would have made the veriest stranger admire it, burst into the
      kitchen, and sank in a heap at the feet of the old negress, who, now
      actually alarmed, seized her by the arm, and with a look of anxiety on her
      black face, asked the girl what had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've seen him&mdash;seen Walter. They said he was dead. Oh, Aunt Lois, he
      looked so brave, so happy. I never thought he <i>could</i> look happy
      again,&rdquo; and the tears streamed down her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now cum here, chile, and sit in yo' old auntie's lap as yo' used to when
      yo' was a tiny gal, and I used to tell yo' stories and sing de old
      plantation melodies. Come, and you'll forgit all about yo' trubbles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lois had cleared her hands by this time of the dough, and as she took the
      girl by the hand, a loud rap sounded on the outside door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, look, there's a whole lot of soldiers on the lawn, but he ain't with
      them!&rdquo; Marie added, as she peered from the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ise not afraid of sogers! What do you want?&rdquo; Aunt Lois said, boldly
      advancing to the door, where a tall soldier in blue stood, with a dozen
      men, all armed. &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; he said rather roughly, but catching sight of
      Marie, whose face was blanched with <span class="pagenum">[281]</span><a
      name="link281" id="link281"></a>terror, he spoke more courteously: &ldquo;I beg
      pardon, Miss, but we are in search of a spy who goes by the name of Walter
      Ryder. We have tracked him to this place, and have orders to arrest him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My&mdash;&rdquo; she choked the telltale words, and with dignity answered:
      &ldquo;Walter Ryder is not a spy, neither is he here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I regret the necessity, Miss, but I must search the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can,&rdquo; she said, haughtily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving the soldiers posted around the house, the sergeant and two of the
      men entered the dwelling, and commenced the search, but it was useless,
      for no trace of Walter was found. When they came to the door of Helen's
      room, they found it locked, and yet they heard voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you were dead,&rdquo; some one was saying. &ldquo;My sister has mourned you
      constantly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They struck the butts of their guns against the panels of the door, and
      demanded admission, but no one answered. They pushed it open, and the girl
      who sat there sprang to her feet, thoroughly frightened, but no one else
      was in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three men looked at each other with a puzzled look. There was but one
      window in the apartment, and that was covered with a mass of clinging
      vines so dense and thick that they formed a complete mat. They pushed
      their bayonets through the tangled mass, but no one was there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen gazed at them as if half stupefied. The sergeant courteously raised
      his cap, and said: &ldquo;Miss, we are in search of a man whom we think is a spy&mdash;he
      certainly was seen in these grounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We do not harbor spies, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not think you do&mdash;but he may have used your premises for a
      hiding-place. I beg your pardon for intruding. Right about face!&rdquo; to his
      men, A still more prolonged search of the grounds revealed nothing, and
      after placing a guard, the remainder left.
    </p>
    <p>
      But where was Marie? As soon as the soldiers had left the room she went
      back to Helen, who sat with bowed head, and <span class="pagenum">[282]</span><a
      name="link282" id="link282"></a>touching her gently on the arm, she
      whispered&mdash;&ldquo;Sister.&rdquo; A tender light shone in Helen's face, but she
      answered&mdash;&ldquo;Marie, if you only knew how I have injured you&mdash;I
      have not been a sister to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a sister to me, dear Helen? Why, you are the dearest of sisters. What
      do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marie, could you dream that your sister, who loves you so dearly, would
      willingly have wronged you so that you never can forgive me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot believe you, Helen. Explain, will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I poisoned our father's mind against you. I wrote him that you were
      receiving Walter Ryder's attentions, and that I had prevented an elopement
      by my watchfulness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helen! How could you? And that is the reason that he would not see me
      when they brought him home wounded. How cruel! Father, you cannot hear me,
      but you must know the truth now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare not ask your forgiveness, nor dare I tell you why I did it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl stood before her sister, and in low and pleading tones she urged&mdash;&ldquo;Tell
      me all, Helen. I <i>will</i> call you sister,&rdquo; as the other put up her
      hand with a gesture of pain. &ldquo;You know how fond you were of Walter once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A frown contracted the brow of the girl who listened, and she buried her
      face in Marie's lap, as she continued&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am ashamed to tell you, my unselfish sister, that I have done such a
      grievous wrong. I, too, loved Walter Ryder. Do not start. I was
      infatuated, and when he asked our dear father's permission to address you,
      I hated him, and from that hour I lost no chance of ruining him in his
      estimation. He went into the Northern army, and that helped my cause.
      Father swore that no daughter of his should marry a man who would take up
      arms against the South. I played a double part. I told Walter of our
      father's objections, and also persuaded him that you were half promised to
      a colonel in our army. He went away, <span class="pagenum">[283]</span><a
      name="link283" id="link283"></a>and was killed at Chattanooga.&rdquo; And the
      stately Helen broke into a passion of weeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sister, who told you that he was killed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have letters from cousin Will, telling me so, and lamenting his death,
      for he was much attached to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you not hear the soldier to-day charge Walter with being a spy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not hear the name of the man they were looking for&mdash;it surely
      was not Walter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rosy flush that rose to her cheeks made Marie turn faint. Could it be
      that her sister cared for him yet?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not look at me as if you doubted me. That foolish passion has burned
      itself out. My only hope is that he lives, so that I may repair, in a
      measure, the wrong I have done you both. When I have seen you pining, my
      heart has ached for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Helen dear, how good you are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The twilight deepened, as they sat there, and a shot was heard, which
      brought them both to their feet. Another rang out, and with a wild cry of
      alarm the girls fled from the house, toward the spot from whence they
      came. Marie saw a form fleeing into the darkening woods, and heard the
      command &ldquo;Halt!&rdquo; It never paused, and as the soldiers raised their rifles
      to fire, she sprang almost in front of their weapons, and cried&mdash;&ldquo;Do
      not fire again. You have killed him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have not fired at all. It was not our shot that struck him, but we
      were about to fire on the man who wounded him, and whom you saw running
      away,&rdquo; Sergeant Hughes said, respectfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a short distance they found Walter Ryder, who was wounded in the side,
      and as they carried him back to camp, he said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take me to the Lieutenant. I can prove my innocence.&rdquo; Marie and Helen
      threw themselves into each other's arms. Old Lois wrung her hands in
      despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tole you no good wud cum outen dat man's comin' round here,&rdquo; she said
      to old Dan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <span class="pagenum">[284]</span><a name="link284" id="link284"></a>doant
      know why not,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Wat you got agin him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He ain't our sort,&rdquo; she said, contemptuously. &ldquo;Nordern men am diffunt
      from Soudern&mdash;doan yo' sense it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dat's not for me to explaticate. But who was it gib'd us our freedom but
      dem same Nordern men; and isn't it worf sumfing to own yo'self? Dat's wat
      de Nordern 'trash,' as you call 'em, has done for you and me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I neber could talk wif you, old man, for youse always on de contrary
      side,&rdquo; and she left the partner of her joys and sorrows with what was
      intended for a very lofty step.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;De old gal doant like my plain speaking,&rdquo; Dan chuckled. &ldquo;But Ise on de
      right side always.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Next morning dawned brightly. As the birds sang their welcome to early
      day, a young girl left the house and walked rapidly toward the camp, a
      quarter of a mile distant. No one would have recognized the elegant Helen
      in her disguise. She wore a calico dress, much faded and too large for
      her, pinned in folds about her form. A sunbonnet hid her lovely face, and
      an old black cape completed the outfit. She carried a basket of fruit, and
      to all appearances was a country lassie seeking a market for her goods.
    </p>
    <p>
      No challenge was given her. The customary &ldquo;Halt!&rdquo; was replaced by a
      gracious smile from the guard, and permission was given her to enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to see the General who has charge here,&rdquo; she said. A broad smile
      was on the soldier's face. &ldquo;The General is out on business just now, Miss.
      Indeed, I haven't seen him for some time. Won't the Lieutenant do as
      well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The haughty look she gave him brought the flippant fellow to his senses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss,&rdquo; he stammered, in an apologetic tone, &ldquo;if you've got anything to
      sell, why you'd do better to see the cook. He buys all our provender, and
      will take your fruit, I'm certain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to see the officer who is in command here,&rdquo; she continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bob,&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[285]</span><a name="link285" id="link285"></a>the
      guard said, &ldquo;go tell the officer of the day that a lady wishes to see
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Lieutenant will see the lady at once,&rdquo; the man said, on his return.
      Conducting her to a tent, she entered, and saw a very handsome young man,
      &ldquo;far handsomer,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;than Walter.&rdquo; His brown eyes rested
      inquiringly upon her as he arose and politely handed her a camp stool. She
      seated herself, but remained silent. He kindly said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you wish to see me on any particular matter? I am at your service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen's heart beat fast. She knew that she was placed in a strange
      position, but she felt she could endure any unjust comment, so that she
      could undo the wrong she had done her sister and Walter Ryder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, I came to ask you if the young man who was shot yesterday, was
      killed?&rdquo; and her voice faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; Lieutenant Gordon thought, &ldquo;she is no simple country girl. Why is
      she interested in a Union soldier?&rdquo; The query gave his voice a tinge of
      bitterness as he made reply&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was not, though he deserved death, for he is a Confederate spy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sir, you are wrong. Believe me, he is no spy, and I will prove it to
      you, if you will only listen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In her excitement she had risen to her feet, and her sun-bonnet had fallen
      off, while her long dark hair rippled over her face, which was flushed and
      eager. Again that bitter feeling crossed the officer's mind as he gazed at
      her, half forgetting that she was waiting for his permission to explain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not shoot him as a spy&mdash;you cannot be so cruel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss, it does not rest with me to decide the fate of the young man. He
      will be tried on the charge of being a spy, and if guilty&mdash;why, you
      know the rules of war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him steadily, and as their gaze met he felt there was some
      powerful reason for the feeling she showed. He waited courteously for her
      to speak, but her lips trembled and her voice failed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have <span class="pagenum">[286]</span><a name="link286" id="link286"></a>you
      any reason to give why he should not be punished?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have&mdash;he is innocent, and I come to you to ask for his life. I
      must tell you the truth, and leave it to your honor to conceal as much of
      the facts as you can, consistent with his safety. My twin sister and I are
      deeply interested in him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so you are yet,&rdquo; he thought, with a jealous pang. &ldquo;He asked my
      father's consent to address her, but was refused because he joined the
      Northern army. I did not like the thought of her marrying him, and I did
      all I could to prevent it. He went away a long time ago, and we heard of
      him now and then, but at last we learned that he was killed at
      Chattanooga. Then my heart turned to fire, for I had driven him away
      without giving him a chance to hear my sister's promises of fidelity. I
      learned quite lately that he was not dead, but that his company was doing
      guard duty at this place. I was so thankful to know that he was alive,
      that I resolved to see him and tell him the truth. I wrote him, begging
      him to come to our house, and at a signal agreed upon I would see him and
      all would be made right. I signed my sister's name, for I wanted to be
      sure he would come. He was just outside my window, and I had begun to
      explain, when your soldiers burst into my room, and he hid in old Dan's
      quarters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I trust the men were not rude to you,&rdquo; Lieutenant Gordon said, alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, they treated us as all true soldiers will, with respect. But oh,
      if Walter is shot, I shall be a murderess!&rdquo; The look of distress upon her
      beautiful face made her still more lovely, so the Lieutenant thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe your story, Miss,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and will investigate at once. He
      had no right to be absent from his post without leave, but I suppose 'the
      end justifies the means,'&rdquo; smiling into her inquiring face. &ldquo;Meanwhile I
      will send a guard with you to insure your safety.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please do not. I came here disguised as a fruit peddler, so as to excite
      no remarks, and I can go back the same way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But <span class="pagenum">[287]</span><a name="link287" id="link287"></a>you
      have not told me what you have done with the young man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has been placed in the hospital. His wound is quite severe, but not
      fatal. The strangest part of the affair is, that not one of our men fired
      a shot. He was wounded by some one unknown to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who could have done it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no idea&mdash;possibly he has some enemy; most of us have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must hurry away. Breakfast will be ready, and my absence will make them
      wonder. Good-morning, sir, and many thanks for your kindness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning, Miss&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mason. I live but a half mile away, and I hope, if you are ever near us,
      you will call and tell us how Walter is. Or, rather, I had better send old
      Dan, our servant, here every day to inquire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not trouble yourself to do that. I will do myself the honor of
      calling, to inform you how his wound progresses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was strange how long it took Walter to recover, or at least how many
      calls Lieutenant Gordon was compelled to make, ere he deemed Marie's
      nerves would endure the shock of seeing him. Helen always had a bright
      welcome for the Lieutenant, and when she requested him to allow Marie and
      herself to visit Walter, the officer shook his head wisely and promised to
      help the wounded soldier over at a very early day. The latter had been
      chafing at the delay. Lieutenant Gordon had long since received proofs of
      his innocence as a spy, and was satisfied that his punishment had been
      severe enough, but his own case perplexed him. Was he pleasing in her
      sight; could she care for him; and how dared he tell her his own feelings?
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Lois was always shaking her head in solemn disapproval. &ldquo;What has dun
      got into dem two chilien?&rdquo; she often asked old Dan. &ldquo;Dey seems to be
      gitting 'witched wif dem couple Norvern men. Dey cahnt eider ob 'em hold a
      candle to Massa Colonel Allison, who's dun gone, on Miss Marie. Why, he's
      de man <span class="pagenum">[288]</span><a name="link288" id="link288"></a>after
      my own mind. His big black eyes flash like diamonds, and dat booful beard
      falls over his mouf like a willow tree. Doan know what young gals is
      tinking of nowadays.&rdquo; Another shake of the head and a puckering up of the
      thick lips. &ldquo;But here cums Dan; he never did like Massa Allison, so I
      won't 'spute wid him, for I 'spises family quarrels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Dan walked slowly and as if thinking deeply, up the path to the
      kitchen door, and stood there, looking in. Aunt Lois at first thought she
      would ignore his presence entirely, but curiosity triumphed, and as he
      showed no desire to talk, but turned off into the woods, she unbent from
      her dignity, and called loudly&mdash;&ldquo;Dan&mdash;ole man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned impatiently, and said&mdash;&ldquo;Let me alone, Ise engaged on
      particular business, dat wimmen don't know nufhn about conducting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lois' nose went up into the air, or rather would have gone, were it not so
      flat and heavy she could not elevate it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How high and mighty old niggers can be!&rdquo; was her retort. For a day or two
      there was an air of mystery about Dan which offended Lois deeply, but she
      wouldn't ask any questions. &ldquo;If my ole man has any secrets from me now at
      his time of life, well, I'll find 'em out,&rdquo; she said to herself. One
      forenoon he astonished her by saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does yo' like Massa Allison?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dus. He's de kind of a gemman dat I likes to see 'roun. Whar's Miss
      Marie's eyes when she cahnt see how far s'perior he is to dose Norvern
      sogers who am jess libin' here now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yer wouldn't like him so well if yer knew he was a 'sassin, would yer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old negress was all attention. &ldquo;A 'sassin, what's dat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A wicked man what tries to murder anuder jess becase he lubs de same gal
      dat he does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whose de man? Whar am he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell yer sumfing, but yer musn't tell. Ise had de secret a long
      time, but I cahnt keep it any longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perceed, <span class="pagenum">[289]</span><a name="link289" id="link289"></a>old
      man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Massa Allison lubs our sweet mistis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Miss Marie, ob course. I 'lows Miss Helen is all right, but she
      cahnt&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dar yo' go, way off from de subjict. What did he do?&rdquo; Dan tiptoed nearer
      to his spouse. &ldquo;Yer 'members de day Massa Walter was shot. I was in dem
      woods after rabbits, when I seed Massa Allison wid a musket, lying flat on
      his face in some high bushes. I felt it was kind o' queer; yo' know he's
      home on leab ob absence, and so I watched him. Quick I heard de report,
      and saw Massa Walter fall right down, and Massa Allison rund away fast as
      a deer. I picked up his hankcher and his name is printed right on it, and
      I've kep' it in my bussum ever since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You telling de troof? If yo' is, my symperthies go right ober to dat ar
      wounded boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ise telling de troof, ole woman. And now yo' see why Ise got no lub for
      Massa Allison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we'd best keep dis yere news to ourselves. Yo' know a nigger's word
      never'd go before a white man's down here, so we'll jess keep our moufs
      shut.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Aunt Lois' prejudices were strong yet, and it took some little
      persuasion on the part of Dan before she would acknowledge that Massa
      Walter was as nice as one ob deir &ldquo;own Soudern men were.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lieutenant Gordon had at first, when the company was assigned to provost
      duty, chafed restlessly, for he preferred being at the front, but as the
      weeks rolled on he became wonderfully resigned to his orders, and so one
      day he assumed a fierce martial look, and stormed the fortress of Helen's
      affections. It was a singularly easy victory, for she capitulated at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      Walter's recovery was slow. When he first met Marie, his joy was almost
      overshadowed by timidity. He could scarce credit the assurance that she
      loved him. He never alluded to her sister's part in their separation, and
      this delicacy won for him <span class="pagenum">[290]</span><a
      name="link290" id="link290"></a>the gratitude of that young girl. The old
      slave, Dan, was jubilant. It had been arranged that Lois and he should
      accompany the two sisters to their Northern homes, where the parents of
      both the bridegrooms were awaiting them, eager to receive them. The dear
      old home was to be occupied by their cousin Will and his wife, a
      sweet-faced Southern girl, who assured them that it would ever be a home
      for them as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      One fine morning in May a double solemn ceremony was performed which bound
      Marie and Walter and Helen and Lieutenant Harry Gordon together, for life.
      A few chosen friends were there, and Lois and Dan were decked out in all
      the colors of the rainbow. Dan chuckled audibly as he informed Lois that
      &ldquo;dat ar Union was what de whole Souf and Norf ought to celebrate&mdash;a
      Union forever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Walters period of service had expired, and he was free to go. Lieutenant
      Gordon was to remain behind until the boys were discharged from the
      service.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will not be long before we shall be together again, dear sister,&rdquo;
       Helen said. &ldquo;General Lee has surrendered, the armies of both sides are
      being disbanded, and the time will pass quickly.&rdquo; They sat on the veranda,
      where they had so often sat, and talked over their dreams and hopes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel, whose shot came near ending a life, had disappeared after his
      murderous attempt. They never heard from him again, and in their luxurious
      homes the sisters dwell, loving and beloved.

    <p>
      HIS <span class="pagenum">[291]</span><a name="link291" id="link291"></a>brave
      and loyal officer was born at &ldquo;Soldiers' Retreat,&rdquo; near Louisville,
      Kentucky, on June 14, 1805. His early days were pleasantly situated, his
      surroundings and companions being of the best. He was a graduate of West
      Point, leaving that school in 1825, when only twenty years of age. He was
      a very apt pupil. He entered the third Artillery, and saw considerable
      fighting in the Black Hawk War in 1832. He was appointed instructor of
      artillery tactics at West Point from 1835 to 1837, when he served in the
      Florida War, and in May, 1838, was made assistant adjutant-general to
      General Scott. He resigned this appointment upon being made captain, and
      accompanied Scott to Mexico in 1847.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was wounded very severely at Molino del Rey, and for a time his life
      was despaired of. In 1857 he was lieutenant in the First Artillery;
      November 20, 1860, he assumed command of Charleston Harbor.
    </p>
    <p>
      His loyalty to the old flag was proven at Forts Moultrie and Sumter. When
      he took command of the former he determined to place it in good condition,
      and he asked for money to make both forts more secure; large sums were
      allowed him for this purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fort Moultrie was far from being impregnable. Indeed, the land side was a
      good point for attack, so he concluded to remove to Fort Sumter, which was
      built on a rock at the entrance to <span class="pagenum">[292]</span><a
      name="link292" id="link292"></a>the bay, and could only be reached by
      boats. He made all his preparations with such secrecy that no one
      suspected his design, not even his second in command, Captain Abner
      Doubleday. The first intimation that the latter received was an order to
      go to Fort Sumter in twenty minutes. The families of the officers were
      sent to Fort Johnson, opposite Charleston, and afterward taken North.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0202" id="linkimage-0202"> </a>

    <p>
      The clever manner in which Major Anderson deceived the Confederates into
      believing that the troops which silently marched through the little
      village of Moultrieville that cold December eve, just after sunset, were
      only laborers going to Fort Sumter, is worthy of the cool and resolute
      commander. When they reached Sumter, the laborers who were at work in the
      interests of the Confederates, putting it in shape for their occupancy,
      opposed the landing of the Union soldiers, but were driven into the fort
      at the point of the bayonet. Major Anderson afterward sent them ashore, in
      the supply boats.
    </p>
    <p>
      At noon of the next day, Major Anderson celebrated his possession of Fort
      Sumter by raising the Stars and Stripes and by prayer and military
      ceremonies.
    </p>
    <p>
      His slender garrison, all told, comprised but sixty-one artillerymen and
      thirteen musicians. After he had thus taken possession of Fort Sumter,
      they did not have a very enjoyable time, for provisions were growing
      scarce, and the markets of Charleston would sell them nothing. Fuel was
      scarce, and the cold was severe. Besides, they had to resort to all sorts
      of stratagems to <span class="pagenum">[293]</span><a name="link293"      id="link293"></a>keep up the appearance of being amply provided with
      ammunition and munitions of war, one of which was the filling of barrels
      with broken stone, with a heavy charge of powder in the center, which they
      would roll down to the water's edge, and burst, giving their watchful
      enemies the impression that the fort was filled with &ldquo;infernal machines.&rdquo;
       The garrison were in no very robust condition for fighting, for salt pork
      was nearly their sum total in the meat line.

      Meanwhile, arguing went on between the Confederates and the garrison, to
      the effect that the United States government had gone to pieces and they
      ought to evacuate the fort quietly. But that was not the sort of material
      that Major Anderson was made of. And when fire was opened upon him, he
      returned it in kind, and fought valiantly. It was not till the 13th that
      he had to surrender. Twice the wooden frame on the inside took fire, and
      when the flag staff on the fort was shot away, a servant <span
      class="pagenum">[294]</span><a name="link294" id="link294"></a>named Peter
      Hart made a staff of a spar, and nailed it to the gun carriages on the
      parapet under the hot fire of the enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 14th Major Anderson and his garrison sadly left the fort after
      saluting the dear old flag, and went on board the <i>Baltic</i>, which
      bore them to New York.
    </p>
    <p>
      In May, 1861, Robert Anderson was made brigadier-general in the United
      States army, commanding the Department of the Cumberland. His health
      failed so rapidly that he was shortly after relieved and brevetted
      major-general in the regular army, when he was retired from service. In
      1868 his health had failed so rapidly that he went to Europe, hoping for
      relief. His translations from the French on military matters, have been
      accepted as valuable textbooks, and are used by the War Department. The
      health he sought eluded him, and his death took place at Nice, France,
      October 26, 1871.

    <p>
      ENERAL ROBERT EDWARD LEE came from what is known in the South, as a good
      family. He was the son of Colonel Henry Lee, who was known in
      Revolutionary days as &ldquo;Lighthorse Harry.&rdquo; Robert was born at Stafford,
      Virginia, January 19, 1807. He became a cadet at West Point in 1825, and
      graduated second in his class, composed of forty-six members, in 1829. He
      never received a mark of demerit or a reprimand during his four years at
      that institution, thus showing that he honored discipline&mdash;a fine
      trait in the young. He became a lieutenant in the corps of engineers, and
      superintending engineer in improvements of the harbor of St. Louis and the
      upper Mississippi. He also served with great distinction as chief engineer
      of the army under General Scott. His gallant conduct at Cerro Gordo,
      Contreras, Churubusco and Chapultepec, in the Mexican War, in the latter
      engagement receiving <span class="pagenum">[295]</span><a name="link295"      id="link295"></a>a severe wound, won him honors, and he was brevetted
      major, lieutenant-colonel and colonel.

    <p>
      He was appointed superintendent of the military, academy at West Point
      from 1852 to 1855, when in the latter year two new regiments of cavalry
      were formed, in the second of which he secured an appointment as
      lieutenant-colonel, a most deserved honor. Two years were spent in Texas,
      but a leave of absence being granted him, he returned to Virginia. He had
      command of the forces sent to suppress old John Brown at Harper's Ferry,
      in October, 1859.
    </p>
    <p>
      The year 1832 was an eventful one to him, for in that year he chose a fair
      daughter of his native State, for his bride. The lady whom he selected was
      Mary Custis, daughter of G. W. P. Custis; the latter was the grandson of
      Martha Custis, and the adopted son of George Washington. General Lee
      became heir to the estates of Arlington House on the Potomac, and the
      White House on the Pamunkey. The Arlington estate was confiscated by the
      Government during the war, and is now national property, and the site of a
      Union soldiers' cemetery.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the ordinance of secession was passed in Virginia, April 17, 1861, he
      at once resigned his commission in the United States army, and wrote to
      General Scott these words&mdash;&ldquo;Save in defence of my native State, I
      never desire again to draw my sword.&rdquo; He felt keenly that there was no
      need of revolution, and would gladly have asked for redress of whatever
      grievances his State felt that they suffered, but in vain, and he declared
      that <span class="pagenum">[296]</span><a name="link296" id="link296"></a>although
      his devotion to the Union was sincere, and he knew what was demanded of
      the duty and loyalty of an American, yet he could not raise his hand
      against his friends, his children, and his home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Virginia had seceded from the Union, but had not yet acknowledged the
      Confederacy. He was chosen major-general of the forces of the State, a
      trust which he honestly assumed, and for more than a year, although he was
      named as one of the five generals whom the State elected after it joined
      the Confederacy, in May, still he was merely superintendent of
      fortifications at Richmond, and a sort of military adviser to Jefferson
      Davis.
    </p>
    <p>
      His military record, as commander of the Southern army, proves him to have
      been one of the ablest generals that history furnishes us any record of.
      When he met General Grant in that little Virginia village, to confer with
      him as to terms of surrender, it was the meeting of two great commanders,
      each worthy of a world's admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the war General Lee refused to attend any public gatherings, but
      lived a secluded life. His fortune had vanished, his hopes had been
      defeated, and he was compelled to accept the position of President of
      Washington College, Lexington, Va. This was in October of 1865. To the
      last he was in favor of reconstruction in the South, without recourse to
      arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the evening of September 28, 1870, he was struck with paralysis, and
      lived but a fortnight, dying on October 12. Thus passed away a man of
      great nobility of character, brave and sincere.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife, Mary, followed him on November 6, 1873. The General had three
      sons and four daughters. All of his sons served in the civil war.

    <p>
      T <span class="pagenum">[297]</span><a name="link297" id="link297"></a>was
      just after the battle of Chancellorsville, and the storm of shot and shell
      had ceased to rain upon the wounded, who were pinioned in the blazing
      woods, when the sudden blow which Stonewall Jackson's army had struck, had
      left a trail of woe and blood. The dense forest had hidden the oncoming of
      Jackson's forces. They stole in noiselessly and fell upon the Union men
      under General Hooker, like an avalanche.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pickets had not given the alarm, so swift and silent had been
      Jackson's advance. The battle was over. The musketry had ceased its
      rattle, and darkness had fallen, lit only by the red blaze which enwrapped
      the Confederate and Union wounded, without mercy. Some of them had tried
      to crawl away from the consuming fire, which played about them, and licked
      up leaves and underbrush, and now and then, as a gust of wind arose,
      sending the burning brands into the treetops to start a new conflagration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The heat burned into their wounds, and as the shrieks of those who could
      not drag themselves away rose on the air, it seemed as if demons were
      calling to each other, so madly did they shout for help and mercy from the
      pitiless wall of fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Men were caught as if in a network, and held prisoners indeed. Choking
      with the smoke, blinded by the sparks whirling in every direction, there
      seemed no hope or chance for rescue.

      dead man's face, caught by the flames, was scorched and disfigured so that
      his dearest friend could not have recognized him. Near him lay a living
      soldier with bloodshot eyes and aching wounds, terror written on his
      features&mdash;terror born, not from the fortunes of battle, not of the
      foe whom he has met face to face, but terror of the black night' the
      loneliness, the awful thought that the dead are all around him, a somber
      scene lit up by the fire that seizes some helpless one, never releasing
      him until he has lost the semblance of a man, and is only a charred
      fragment.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night was a fearful reality to many. Its horrors can never be told,
      for those best able to repeat the story, perished where they lay. Details
      were sent out by the Federals after Jackson's advance had been checked, to
      save the victims in the burning forest, and heroically they worked, but
      alas, they could not reach half of the wounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the foot of an oak whose lofty head towered above the scene, two
      soldiers fought valiantly for life. They were no longer arrayed against
      each other, but against their mutual enemy, the fire-fiend. One wore the
      blue, the other the gray. Both had gaping wounds, but their peril was the
      same, and as they struggled to their feet, weak from loss of blood, the
      bitterness died out of their hearts. They were once more friends,
      comrades, and together they labored to stamp out the destroyer. Their
      breath came quick and short, their voices sank to a whisper, but shoulder
      to shoulder as of old, they met as brothers&mdash;and nobly they battled
      with the flames, now smothering a burst of fire, now cheering each other
      with brave words, until, slowly and painfully they advanced, step by step,
      to a spot where the cool ground received them, as they fell, fainting,
      almost dying, where they were found by the boys who were sent to rescue,
      and whose work had been that of heroes.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when, once more they struggled back to life, hand met hand in a
      friendly grasp, and heart beat joyously to heart, as they thanked their
      heavenly Father that they were saved from a fiery furnace.

      was a product of the war&mdash;one of those stray &ldquo;chilluns&rdquo; who drifted
      into camp with the refugees who were constantly coming under Uncle Sam's
      paternal care.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was but a short time before he drifted out again and into our home. We
      (Allie and I) were in search of a boy &ldquo;to run errands,&rdquo; and do odd jobs
      about the house, and this particular boy was sent to me by one of our
      soldier friends. When we saw his mirthful face (he had a perpetual grin)
      we thought he'd do very nicely for us. It was quite the fashion for boys
      to work in families in Memphis, washing dishes, preparing vegetables, and
      kindred labors, and though at first our Northern ideas were rudely
      disturbed by that fact, we soon became used to it, and enjoyed having a
      boy for such work. Indeed, it was rather a relief to Allie, for, as she
      said, if she hired a girl of the same age she would be in a measure
      responsible for her manners, and she would have to instruct her in the
      care of her wardrobe; but with a boy no such difficulties presented
      themselves. Like too many white boys of good families, it was supposed a
      boy could knock around and shift for himself; in other words he did not
      need any particular care, beyond providing him with enough to eat, drink
      and wear.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy informed us when he came to us that his name was Percy. Allie
      suggested that it would be much more ready to call him Jim or Sam. In an
      instant his family pride was up in arms.

      Missie, but I cahnt go back on my raising dat ar way. It wud be slighting
      my marsa's family. Percy it is, and I cahnt see my way clar to answer to
      no oder name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We afterward learned that his name was Jerry, and that he had fallen
      deeply in love with the name Percy, it belonging to a colonel in the
      Southern army who used to visit at his master's house, and so he had
      appropriated it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Percy it remained, and if it was rather incongruous to see the
      high-born Percy scrubbing the kitchen floor or delving into the garbage
      box in search of a silver fork or spoon that he had thrown in with the
      remains of a meal, it couldn't be helped.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had some odd ways about him, that rather startled Allie. He believed in
      Voodooism and when one day he informed her in a stage whisper that a very
      elegant old lady who called often, but who had lost one eye through some
      misfortune, was a witch, and was trying to &ldquo;spell&rdquo; him, she promptly
      ordered him out of the house till he could learn to keep his thoughts to
      himself. He despised winter, and one morning when he woke up and saw a
      light snowfall that had come down the night before, he expressed himself
      thus&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Missie, that's what you uns calls pretty. I jess tinks it's de debil
      whispering bad tings to de earth, and she's ashamed of 'em, and cobers up
      her face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He never could be made to understand why certain articles in the china
      closet should have certain places. As for instance the closet in our house
      had shelves way down to the floor and he insisted on placing the
      silverware on the lowest shelf and then stepping into it. He had been
      talked to and threatened with punishment, and every time he'd promise to
      do better. One morning as usual the spoons, knives, etc., were found in
      the old place, and the look of perfect astonishment on his face would have
      immortalized a painter could he have caught it, as he threw up his hands
      and rolling up his eyes, said in the most tragic manner:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I clar to goodness, Missie, I neber know how dey cum dar&mdash;dey must
      have walked down all by demselves!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He <span class="pagenum">[303]</span><a name="link303" id="link303"></a>went
      to market every day with his mistress, to show her how to select, as he
      confidentially informed his companions&mdash;-&ldquo;Yer see she's only a chile,
      not far frum my age (he was sixteen, she was nineteen) and isn't
      'sperienced in de tricks of dem ar market folks, so I goes along and helps
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We had been teasing for a dish of roast goose for a long time, so Percy
      and his mistress started just after breakfast and made a tour of the
      stalls. She selected a huge, but plump-looking white fowl, whose snowy
      feathers attracted her attention. She was quite ready to accept Percy's
      assurance that &ldquo;dat ar fowl will make seberal good meals.&rdquo; The bird was
      purchased, and Percy slung it over his shoulder, while it squawked most
      horribly as mistress and boy went down the length of the market, greeted
      at every step by the grinning colored folks, who wished them &ldquo;good luck
      wid dat ar young bird!&rdquo; while some were anxious to know &ldquo;whar yo' get dat
      snow bird, honey?&rdquo; accompanied with many fervent hopes that it would &ldquo;eat
      like cream.&rdquo; When the fowl reached the home of Percy's mistress, she
      nearly died with chagrin to find that what she preferred for its snowy
      plumage, thinking it an evidence of youth and beauty, proved to be a
      gander whose tough old skin Charlie assured her no amount of heat could
      penetrate. So when she slyly opened the gate, and bade him wander forth,
      he did so without delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Percy pretended much sympathy for her discomfiture, but she lost faith in
      all humanity after the goose episode, and deputed the marketing to her
      brother and the boy, who kindly relieved her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Percy was not entirely a trifler, as a few weeks after proved. One
      night when all were sleeping and the night was full of beauty, a little
      flame, so fine it was scarce observable, shot up into the room where the
      master and mistress reposed. It grew larger, as it danced across the
      floor, and curled up over the windows, drawn by the night breeze that
      played there. Now it seized the curtains of the bed, and still they knew
      nothing of the danger. And now the flames burst forth, lighting up the
      whole room, A feeling of suffocation, a frightened cry, and they awake,
      <span class="pagenum">[304]</span><a name="link304" id="link304"></a>but
      the smoke is thick and lurid, they are blinded and dazed. Where is the
      window&mdash;how can they find the door? They are silent from fear, while
      the flames leap nearer and nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ise here&mdash;doncher be feared! Percy's here to sabe you bof,&rdquo; and in
      the boy springs, and seizing Allie by the arm, he calls to her husband to
      follow close after him. He dashes to the window; he steps upon a ladder,
      and half-carrying her down, he shouts words of cheer to Charlie, who waits
      till they have reached the ground, when he takes to the ladder, and
      follows in safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking up, they see the room one mass of fire, and they know that they
      owe their lives to the watchful care of the black boy who had been only
      the subject for mirth and ridicule in their little home.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were grieved indeed, when, a week later he came to the friend's house
      where they had found shelter, and after much scraping and bowing, he told
      them he wanted to &ldquo;gage in anoder business&mdash;shining gemmen's shoes.&rdquo;
       They tried to persuade him that it was a precarious occupation, and rather
      uncertain of returns, but there was an independence about it that Percy
      craved. So they had to bid the boy good-bye, but the generous donation
      which Charlie and Harry gave him to &ldquo;set him up in business,&rdquo; made his
      eyes shine and his teeth glisten, as he &ldquo;fanked dem, and wished 'em luck.&rdquo;

      ANY <span class="pagenum">[305]</span><a name="link305" id="link305"></a>are
      the monuments that have been erected in Richmond, Virginia, through the
      liberality of her citizens. That city has paid particular attention to her
      brave boys who fell in battle, and her cemeteries are very beautifully
      laid out. The word cemetery is from the Greek, and means a
      &ldquo;sleeping-place.&rdquo; There, indeed, do those who laid down their lives sleep
      in peace, and it is the pride and pleasure of the living to beautify their
      last home. National cemeteries were first provided for by our government
      on July 17, 1862, and the noble provision has been carried out in all the
      States, both North and South.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oakwood cemetery, Richmond, contains 16,000 dead Confederate soldiers.
      Libby Hill has a towering granite column, of great beauty, dedicated to
      all the soldier and sailor dead of the Confederacy&mdash;a beautiful
      memorial.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cemetery of Hollywood is particularly distinguished for being the
      resting-places of Generals Stuart, Pickett, and Maury. Each grave has a
      tasty monument erected over it to tell who slumbers beneath. This cemetery
      has ninety-five acres, and was established in 1847. There are 12,000
      Confederate soldiers in this picturesque burying-ground, and a granite
      pyramid has been raised to their memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      All <span class="pagenum">[306]</span><a name="link306" id="link306"></a>civilizations
      have respected and cared for their dead. Even the Indian decorates the
      graves of his people, and watches that they may lie undisturbed. He places
      the weapons of the chase in the grave that they may take them to the Happy
      Hunting Ground with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Richmond has several cemeteries wherein her soldiers lie, it is
      noticeable for the statues of her heroes also. General William C.
      Wickham's statue adorns Monroe Park. One of the finest streets, Franklin,
      has a statue of General Robert E. Lee and General A. P. Hill, General
      &ldquo;Jeb&rdquo; Stuart, and President Jefferson Davis are also remembered.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the eighty-three National cemeteries established by the United States,
      and containing 330,700 soldiers, 9,438 wore the gray.

      In the cemetery at Beaufort, South Carolina, all feelings of distinction
      are swept away, and yearly, on Memorial Day, the noble-hearted women of
      that town direct their steps toward the graves and place flowers upon all&mdash;those
      who wore the blue and those who wore the gray, alike appealing to their
      womanly sympathy, and sharing alike their tender care.

      On October 23, 1866, a fine and spacious cemetery was dedicated at
      Winchester, Virginia, with most imposing ceremonies. This abode of the
      dead is known as the Stonewall Jackson cemetery, in honor of that brave
      and true-hearted soldier.

      years have gone by since the scenes told of in the first part of our book
      were enacted by the boy, whose interest has never wavered, and whose heart

      eager to draw the sword, if need be, in defence of their beloved land and

    <h2>
      ULYSSES S. GRANT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      General Grant's career was so extraordinarily brilliant, and was
      compressed into so short a time that it stands almost alone as one of the
      most astonishing succession of events.
    </p>
    <p>
      His birthplace was Point Pleasant, Ohio. Here on the 27th of April, 1822,
      the future general was born. When he was but a year old his parents moved
      to Georgetown, where he grew into a sturdy, quiet lad, showing no
      particular smartness any more than the average boy. Indeed, he was rather
      dull, learning rather slowly, and with difficulty. There were no free
      schools when he was a boy. These institutions were supported by
      subscription, and one teacher had charge of all the pupils&mdash;from the
      primer class to the big boy or girl of eighteen.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Grant never saw an algebra nor any mathematical work until he went
      to West Point. He had a great fondness for horses, and was never so happy
      as when he could be with them. He was an excellent judge of them. When he
      was but seven he drove his father's horses, hauling all the wood used in
      the house and shops. When he was fifteen he made a horse trade with a Mr.
      Payne, at Flat Rock, Kentucky, where he was visiting. The brother of this
      gentleman was to accompany young Grant back to Georgetown. The boy was
      told that the horse had never had a collar on (it was a saddle horse), but
      he hitched it up, and started to drive the seventy miles with a strange
      animal. The horse ran and kicked, and made the companion horse frightened,
      and Ulysses stopped them right on the edge of an embankment twenty <span
      class="pagenum">[309]</span><a name="link309" id="link309"></a>feet deep.
      Every time he would start, the new horse would kick and run, until Mr.
      Payne, who was thoroughly frightened, would not proceed any further in his
      company, but took passage in a freight wagon. The boy was left alone, but
      with that faculty for surmounting difficulties which distinguished him in
      after life, a happy thought struck him&mdash;he took out his bandana, a
      huge handkerchief much used then, and blindfolded the creature, driving
      him quietly to the house of his uncle in Maysville, where he borrowed
      another horse.
    </p>

    <p>
      A laughable incident occurred when he was eight. He saw a colt which he
      very much coveted, and for which the owner demanded $25. General Grant's
      father said he would give $20. The boy was so anxious to possess the colt
      that his father yielded, giving him instructions how to make the bargain.
      Going to the owner the boy said: &ldquo;Papa says I may offer you $20 for the
      colt, but if you won't take that I am to offer $22.50, and if you won't
      take that, to give you $25.&rdquo; It is needless to say what he had to pay for
      the colt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The elder Grant was not poor in the usual sense of the term&mdash;on the
      contrary, he was quite well situated for the time and place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ulysses was sent to West Point at seventeen; he was quite apt in
      mathematics, but had no love for military tactics, and resolved <span
      class="pagenum">[310]</span><a name="link310" id="link310"></a>not to stay
      in the army, even if he graduated. He was not brilliant in his class here,
      either&mdash;he says himself that had &ldquo;the class been turned the other end
      foremost, I should have been near the head.&rdquo; He graduated four years after
      his entrance, No. 21 in a class of thirty-nine.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      It was feared at that time that he had the consumption, for he had a bad
      cough, but his outdoor life entirely removed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      His real name was Hiram Ulysses Grant, but some one made a blunder in
      making out the document appointing him a cadet, and as U. S. Grant he will
      be known always.
    </p>
    <p>
      On graduation he was breveted Second Lieutenant of Infantry, and placed in
      the Fourth Regiment, which was sent to the frontier. But two years went
      by, ere he was sent to Texas to join General Taylor's army, and here he
      became a full lieutenant. He was made quartermaster of his regiment early
      in 1847, after showing great valor in the battles of Palo Alto, Resaca,
      Monterey, and the siege of Vera Cruz. He participated in all of the
      engagements, and was promoted on the field of Molino del Rey for his
      bravery. A few days after an exhibition of the same quality won him
      special notice and praise from his brigade commander.
    </p>
    <p>
      When <span class="pagenum">[311]</span><a name="link311" id="link311"></a>the
      Mexican War was over, he was stationed at: Sackett's Harbor, New York. He
      had long been attached to Miss Julia Dent, the sister of one of his
      classmates, and August 22, 1848, she became his wife.

    <p>
      Four years later he went with his regiment to California and Oregon, where
      he became captain. The summer of 1854 saw, apparently, an end to his
      military career, for he resigned his commission and tried to work a small
      farm near St. Louis, and attend to real estate in the city. He was <span
      class="pagenum">[312]</span><a name="link312" id="link312"></a>not
      intended for either vocation. Greater things were in store for him, and,
      disheartened at his poor success, he went to work for his father, as clerk
      in his store&mdash;the leather trade, in Galena, Illinois.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the first sound of war he offered his services to the government, and
      marched to Springfield at the head of a company. Governor Yates placed him
      on his staff, and made him mustering officer of all the volunteers from
      Illinois, but in June he was made colonel of the Twenty-first Regiment,
      which he had organized and drilled himself. Needing cars to transport it
      to a distant point, he was told they could not be furnished. So little a
      matter as that did not annoy him, but with that directness and energy
      which always marked his movements, he astonished the authorities by
      marching the entire regiment to the desired place.
    </p>
    <p>
      In August he was promoted, becoming brigadier-general, and assuming
      command of all troops at Cairo. From this hour his successes were great,
      and have become matters of history. He was the idol of the army, and the
      surprise of the country, which gave him the popular name which seems to
      fit him so well&mdash;Unconditional Surrender Grant.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the siege of Vicksburg and the defeat of General Bragg, it became
      plain to the government that one great mind should control all the forces,
      and General Grant was declared commander of the entire armies of the
      Union, early in 1864.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was then that President Lincoln and General Grant met for the first
      time&mdash;a meeting between two great men. The commission of full general
      was bestowed upon Grant in July, 1866, this title being created especially
      for him. From August, 1867, to January, 1868, he was really Secretary of
      War, on account of the trouble between President Johnson and Secretary
      Stanton. He received the nomination for President, in May, 1868, at the
      hands of the Republican convention which met in Chicago, and was elected
      by an overwhelming majority. He was reelected to a second term and at its
      close he made a tour of the world, with his wife. He was received with
      unbounded enthusiasm everywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1881 he <span class="pagenum">[313]</span><a name="link313" id="link313"></a>bought
      a house in New York City, which he made a home in the fullest sense, for
      his family and himself. On Christmas Eve, 1883, he slipped on the
      sidewalk, and injured himself so badly that he had to use crutches ever
      after. Becoming partner in a banking house, he was robbed of all he had by
      his associates in business and had to turn his attention to literary work,
      furnishing the <i>Century</i> with some articles. Being solicited to give
      his experiences, he wrote his &ldquo;Memoirs,&rdquo; which he indited while suffering
      great anguish, and which he finished four days before his death. His wife
      received for the two volumes from his pen $400,000 as royalty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hero of many battles, the grand soldier, was doomed. In 1884 a trouble
      in his throat developed into a cancer, and for nearly a year he endured
      intense agony, never murmuring, but working on, that he might place those
      he so dearly loved beyond want.
    </p>
    <p>
      On July 23, 1885, he died, in a cottage at Mt. McGregor, near Saratoga,
      New York&mdash;a man whom the world is better for having known.

      JAMES ABRAM GARFIELD.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Few boys have risen from such humble surroundings to the highest gift of a
      great nation, as did the twentieth President of the United States, James
      A. Garfield. His boyhood's home was a simple cabin in the woods of Ohio,
      unbroken save by the few settlers who hewed the trees and made a clearing
      for a home. His father was one of these pioneers, and the future President
      of our great Republic was a genuine farmer's boy, and knew how to do all
      the hard work upon a farm. He chopped wood, and helped care for the few
      acres they called their farm. They did not live in luxury, for they had no
      means to squander. Living on the plainest fare, wild game and corn, or
      wheat cracked or pounded in a mortar, performing the hardest labor, the
      boy's strength grew, until he became a hardy, robust lad, the pride of his
      beloved parents.

      parents could send him to the district school, but most excellent use he
      made of his scant opportunities. At fourteen he was apprenticed to a
      carpenter, and three years later he worked on the canal. When he was a
      mere lad, he longed to be a sailor, but he fell sick, and after that he
      never seemed to long for the sea.

      The little village of Orange, Ohio, where he was born on the nineteenth of
      November, 1831, was soon to see him no more as a resident, for in March,
      1849, he left home and entered Geauga Seminary at Chester, and soon was
      fitted to teach a district school. But he had to work at his trade (the
      carpenter's) to help pay his way, his mother not being able to assist him,
      save by a loan of $17.00 which she furnished him the first term that he
      was there. Every morning and evening, and Saturdays, as well as his entire
      summer vacation, he spent in labor at the bench. The next three years he
      passed in the Eclectic Institute at Hiram, and here his finances still
      continuing low, he willingly acted as student and janitor, and afterward
      as student and teacher. He was unable to earn enough to pay for his
      tuition at William's College, and although he practised the closest
      economy, when he graduated he owed that institution $500, a debt which he
      afterward faithfully discharged.
    </p>
    <p>
      He accepted the Professorship of Ancient Languages and Literature in Hiram
      College, at twenty-six becoming its president, which he continued to be
      until he entered the army in 1861.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1858 he married Lucretia Rudolph, who was a teacher, and a very
      cultivated woman, who proved a valuable companion in his literary career.
      He had studied law while President of the college, and was admitted to
      practice in the Supreme Court cf the United States in 1866.

      He made many able speeches in Congress, and was elected to the

      The year 1880 was an important one to James A. Garfield, for in January he
      was elected by the Ohio Legislature Senator for the term beginning March
      4, 1881, to succeed Allen G. Thurman. But on the 8th of June a still
      greater honor was shown him by the Chicago convention, which nominated him
      for president, and the November election showed him to be the choice of
      the people.
    </p>
    <p>
      His public life was destined to be a short one, for on the morning of July
      2, 1881, with bright expectations of a pleasant trip to New York and the
      White Mountains with his wife and several members of the Cabinet, he
      started from the White House for the Baltimore and Potomac station. As
      Secretary Blaine and he entered the station, arm in arm, they passed
      through the ladies' waiting-room. As they walked briskly on, two pistol
      shots were fired in quick succession, one of which took effect in the
      President's back. He sank to the floor, but was conscious. Dr. Bliss was
      summoned, and took charge of the case, but he named three other surgeons
      as assistants. Later two very celebrated physicians were added to the list
      of medical advisers. Their united opinion was that the ball had grazed the
      liver, and lodged in the front wall of the abdomen, but that it was not
      necessarily fatal. Still they did not deem it wise to extract it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The assassin who struck down a good man, was Charles J. Guiteau, a crazy,
      disappointed office-seeker. After suffering for weeks, and fluctuating
      between hope of recovery and unfavorable symptoms, he died at Elberon
      Park, New Jersey, whither he had been removed on the 19th of September,
      1881.
    </p>
    <p>
      His life, with its early struggles, is a lesson to the boys of this age,
      to show them what great possibilities are within the reach of an American
      citizen.

    <p>
      ARLY <span class="pagenum">[318]</span><a name="link318" id="link318"></a>in
      October, 1851, the first effort at laying a cable for a submarine
      telegraph was begun by the United States brig Dolphin, which carried a
      line of soundings across the Atlantic. At that time there were but
      eighty-seven nautical miles of submarine cable laid, while now there are
      nearly 200,000 statute miles. Some of these cables merely connect islands
      with the main shore, others are thousands of miles long. A cable is laid
      so far below the surface that neither storms, tides or currents can
      disturb it. But the ends touching the shore are made much stronger and
      heavier, so that the waves will not impair them, and in some cases, near
      landings, they are heavily weighted to keep them in place&mdash;a thing it
      is not necessary to do in deep water.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1854 Cyrus W. Field obtained a charter for laying a cable, and when the
      first attempt was made at Kerry, Ireland, in 1857, the occasion was made a
      very brilliant affair. It was honored by the presence of a vast squadron
      of British and American ships of war. Representatives of many nations were
      there, as well as the directors of the Atlantic Telegraph Company, and
      most of the magnates of the English railroads. It was a momentous
      undertaking, but after laying 335 miles of cable, and causing the heart of
      its projectors to beat high with hope, <span class="pagenum">[319]</span><a
      name="link319" id="link319"></a>the strands suddenly parted, and their
      hopes were crushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next year another expedition was commenced, which ended in a similar
      failure. But nothing could dampen the ardor of its friends, and on the
      16th of August of the same year another cable was successfully laid, and
      on the 17th Queen Victoria sent the President of the United States
      congratulations upon the successful termination of this great
      international work, to which Mr. Buchanan returned the courteous wish that
      the cable might &ldquo;prove to be a bond of perpetual peace and friendship
      between the kindred nations.&rdquo; The two continents held great rejoicings,
      but disappointment was again their portion, for about the 1st of September
      the cable throbbed no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1865 a further attempt was made, and after 1,200 miles had been laid,
      the cable broke again. So grand an undertaking was not to be given up
      lightly. Mr. Field's perseverance was unconquerable. A strong, flexible
      cable was shipped on board the &ldquo;Great Eastern,&rdquo; and on the 13th of July,
      1866, this gigantic boat started from Valentia, Ireland, and two weeks
      later it &ldquo;glided calmly into Heart's Content, Newfoundland, dropping her
      anchor in front of the telegraph house, having trailed behind her a chain
      of 2,000 miles, to bind the Old World to the New.&rdquo; It then went back to
      the mid-Atlantic, grappled the end of the broken cable of 1865, a splice
      was made, and the line was continued to Newfoundland by the side of the
      other. These lines have never failed to work. The cable having thus become
      a fact, the world was astonished and gratified. Mr. Field had worked
      heroically, and by our own land, by England and by France he was
      enthusiastically praised. The first message which passed over this line
      was a worthy one&mdash;the announcement of the treaty of peace between
      Prussia and Austria.
    </p>
    <p>
      The charges for telegraphing were formerly very high, twenty pounds for a
      short message being asked, but as rival companies began to spring up,
      competition reduced the price considerably.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marine cables have multiplied so fast that where there was originally but
      one or two, there are now eight, owned and operated <span class="pagenum">[320]</span><a
      name="link320" id="link320"></a>at a vast benefit to the entire world with
      which we are in communication. The events occurring in the most distant
      climes are brought to our doors through this medium so perfect is the
      system. Cyrus W. Field received a gold medal from Congress in recognition
      of his services, and the gratitude of the world, as well.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>ew can realize the
      magnitude of this far Northwest territory. To most boys and girls it seems
      a cold, barren, desolate country, a perpetual scene of ice-bound rivers
      and frost and snow the whole year round, with nothing growing. When
      Secretary Seward accomplished the purchase of this vast tract of land from
      Russia, he showed great wisdom and foresight. No wonder that, in view of
      its immense size and valuable resources, he declared the conclusion of
      this affair the crowning triumph of his life.
    </p>

    <p>
      Russia had been anxious to sell for a long time, but many feared that she
      had drained all the value from the territory, and wanted to get rid of it.
      There was bitter opposition in the United States to the plan of buying
      what every one considered would prove but &ldquo;a field of ice and a sea of
      mountains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We want to tell the young folks how great a mistake these sort of
      reasoners labored under, and how we came to be the fortunate buyers of
      this vast stretch of land.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many years ago a party of American explorers conceived the idea of
      establishing a telegraph between our country and Asia, and they went to
      Alaska for this purpose. Fancy their surprise when they saw what they had
      supposed was a desert waste, producing the largest pine and cedar trees in
      the whole world, and the most extensive seal-fisheries, with here and
      there a town, with <span class="pagenum">[321]</span><a name="link321"      id="link321"></a>its churches and buildings. They at once saw how rich it
      was in natural advantages, and they became very anxious that our
      government should confer with Russia as to its purchase. They presented
      good reasons for this desire to Congress, and Secretary Seward saw at once
      what an acquisition it would be to us, in many ways. So in March, 1867,
      the treaty between our country and Russia looking to its sale was
      ratified. It had at that time a native population of 60,000, and since we
      have come into possession of it, the United States Commissioner of
      Education has started schools and appointed teachers to care for the
      education of the young. There are now twenty-four of these schools in the
      different settlements, two of them in Sitka and a manual training school
      has been organized here also, where they receive instruction in the
      various trades. This school must be very popular, for it has a large
      attendance for a small city like Sitka, it numbering over 200 pupils on
      its list.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chief city, or capital, is Sitka, very romantically situated on the
      shore, while high mountains rise behind it, forming a beautiful background
      for the streets and dwellings. It is an old-fashioned, quiet place, when
      compared with bustling American towns, but it boasts a lively weekly
      paper, and the Russo-Greek church has a good edifice there, showing that
      the religious education of its people has not been forgotten. The harbor
      is very beautiful, being deep, and affording safe shelter for vessels.
    </p>
    <p>
      The purchase of this territory has extended our northern boundary from the
      49th to the 71st parallel, and added to our growth westward by sixty
      degrees of longitude. It can boast of the highest mountain in America, Mt.
      St. Elias, which rises 14,000 feet above the sea. The magnificent Yukon
      river runs through the territory, and steamers of light draft can sail on
      its waters for 1,500 miles. We have gained 600,000 square miles, and this
      vast area really cost our government the trifling sum of two cents an
      acre, the sum paid Russia being $7,200,000. It would require thirteen of
      our States to equal its extent. As a writer jovially remarked, &ldquo;It is a
      gilt-edged real estate investment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The <span class="pagenum">[322]</span><a name="link322" id="link322"></a>climate
      is quite endurable. The winters in the northern portion are excessively
      severe, but on the southwest coast it is warmer at that season than either
      Maine or Dakota.
    </p>
    <p>
      The salmon are very plentiful, as well as mackerel, cod and herring. The
      streams are full of them. The salmon rival those of the Columbia and
      Fraser rivers, and immense canneries are daily in operation in the summer,
      preparing them for the markets of the world. The Chinese do this work
      principally, and they are brought up from San Francisco for this purpose
      and taken back there in the Fall. Fish are mostly caught in fish traps and
      nets, but the natives spear them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The largest stamp-mill on this continent for reducing gold-bearing quartz
      is in operation near the town of Juneau.
    </p>
    <p>
      Agriculture does not flourish on account of the shortness of the summers.
      Gardening on a small scale goes on, and plenty can be raised for home use.
      The region so long remaining almost unknown, has suddenly become the
      desired bourne for men and women of all classes. It has always been known
      that its mineral resources were fine, and gold has been found there in
      small quantities, but the hardships endured in getting it from the soil
      were too great in proportion to the amount, but a new impetus to the
      labors of the gold seeker has been given by the discovery of the precious
      metal in such large quantities that thousands have rushed to this field
      eager to dig for the yellow ore. Steamers are leaving Pacific ports
      weekly, laden with those who are willing to brave the terrors of the
      Chilkoot Pass. If the tales are true, it is surely a land of' untold
      riches, as the entire region is gold-bearing, and for some years to come,
      that metal will be found by some, in paying quantities. One authority, Dr.
      Becker, states that the beach sand all along the Alaskan coast contains
      enormous quantities of gold. But even though there was not an ounce of it
      in the whole territory, Alaska has paid back to our commerce its price
      several times over.

      It had been the desire of many patriotic people for ten years to make a
      showing of our resources, and to invite, as it were, the whole world to
      see us at home. The hope had never met with favor, but by repeated
      representations as to the importance of the idea, the people of the United
      States were at last <span class="pagenum">[324]</span><a name="link324"      id="link324"></a>aroused, and worked so faithfully and rapidly to carry it
      out, as to surprise the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      President Grant, on behalf of the United States, asked the nations to take
      part in our rejoicing, and they responded promptly, by sending
      commissioners to attend to the details. Congress appropriated large sums,
      and all the States entered into the undertaking with hearty good-will.
    </p>
    <p>
      City governments and private individuals also contributed freely. A site
      was chosen, Fairmount Park, Philadelphia, one of the most charming
      locations which could have been found. Five large buildings were
      constructed, covering an area of twenty acres.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each State erected a building, as did many foreign nations, within which
      to exhibit the products and manufactures of that particular State.
    </p>
    <p>
      The exposition was opened by President Grant, with Dom Pedro, Emperor of
      Brazil, and his empress, by his side. Theodore Thomas' orchestra furnished
      the music, playing eighteen airs at the opening, the last of which, Hail
      Columbia, met with tumultuous applause. A cantata came next, a prayer by
      Bishop Simpson, and a hymn followed written by Whittier, the Quaker poet.
      General Hawley presented the buildings and their contents to the
      President, who accepted them in a few words, announcing that the
      exhibition was open. The two ponderous Corliss engines which were to put
      the whole machinery going, were set in motion by the President and the
      Emperor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The exhibition was formally closed November 10, 1876, after a season of
      unexampled prosperity, in the simplest manner. Addresses were made by
      General Hawley and several others, the entire audience sang &ldquo;America,&rdquo; and
      President Grant declared the International Exhibition closed. But it had
      taught foreign powers a lesson of respect for our republic, and caused
      wider intercourse between the Old World and the New.

      fire excites exceeds all other causes for fear. It is a subtle power that
      the average person cannot cope with. Its exhibitions are so terrible, so
      changeable, and so unmanageable, that it temporarily unnerves or
      unbalances the calmest brain. Great conflagrations have raged in many
      lands, and in all ages, doing exceeding great damage, but it is yet to be
      recorded that a fire ever swept over so wide a territory, and swallowed up
      so large an amount of wealth and products, sacrificing so much life as did
      the great Chicago Fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The history of the prominent events of the times would be incomplete were
      not the attention of the boys and girls of to-day directed to an
      occurrence so startling as to arouse the sympathies of the entire world.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fire started on the night of October 8, 1871. The previous summer had
      been especially dry and hot, and was prolific of fires, many cities and
      towns having suffered in this respect, and the lumber districts of
      Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, and the forests of New York State, having
      been visited by the destroying element. Many causes have been assigned for
      this fire, but its origin will probably remain forever unknown. It burned
      with unabated fierceness for two days, and three-fourths of the city were
      literally reduced to ashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the evening of Saturday, the 7th, a fire had broken out in <span
      class="pagenum">[328]</span><a name="link328" id="link328"></a>a portion
      of the West Division of the city, and consumed property to the value of a
      million of dollars. This was thought a terrible fire, and was heralded in
      all the Sabbath morning papers; thousands visited the spot on that day,
      and commented on and shuddered at the loss. Little did they apprehend that
      the same evening, Sunday, October 8, a fire would take place which would
      do the most deadly work, ruining business, licking up homes and property,
      destroying human life, and almost wiping out a whole city, whose
      prosperity and energy had become famous.

    <p>
      Nothing escaped. Private homes, public buildings, churches, banks,
      theaters, the postoffice, courthouse, newspaper edifices, hotels, <span
      class="pagenum">[329]</span><a name="link329" id="link329"></a>all fell
      before it, and not until General Sheridan ordered the blowing up of
      buildings, was its progress stayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      At half-past three in the morning, while a strong southwest wind was
      blowing, the anxious citizens were informed that the North Side was
      attacked by the fire fiend, and one of the first victims to its wrath was
      the engine house of the waterworks, thus cutting off the supply of water
      for use in fighting the flames, and driving the terrified people to
      despair. From here it leaped northward, taking in the elevators on the
      river banks, with their millions of bushels of grain, setting fire to
      vessels lying at anchor, then to the cemetery nearest the city, and to the
      beautiful park known as Lincoln, in short, to every conceivable object
      which could furnish food for the monster of destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tramp of hundreds of people fleeing from the fire, the shrieks of
      terror, the noise of the engines, the hoarse shouts and calls of those who
      searched in vain for their dear ones separated from them in the mad chase
      for life, the thunderous fall of stately structures, the roaring,
      crackling, howling flames, made a wild scene that Pandemonium was silence
      compared with. The fire burned the North Side until there was no trace of
      a building left standing save one, the residence of Mahlon D. Ogden, which
      stood in a large plat of ground, entirely detached. On the site of this
      house has since been erected a fine building of stone, devoted to a public
      library, and called the Newberry. The northern city limits and the lake
      were the only barriers to the further encroachments of the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blazing brands were seen sailing through the air, and, falling in some
      spot as yet untouched, they would kindle a new fire. The heat was intense,
      the very air one breathed almost scorched the throat. One vast sea of
      flame melted marble and stone till it crumbled and fell. But oh, blessed
      relief! The thousands who camped out on the prairie that night welcomed
      the torrents of rain that fell, even though it chilled them through.
      People went nearly mad with terror on that dreadful night. Robbers and
      thieves were busy plying their trade, taking everything they could <span
      class="pagenum">[330]</span><a name="link330" id="link330"></a>carry away.
      Some of these perished with their ill-gotten gains. The lake was a welcome
      refuge, and hundreds waded out as far into its waters as they dared, to
      escape the heat that lay behind them. It was said that many were drowned
      through their temerity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 10th of October rose upon a waste, whose dwellers were clothed in the
      apathy of despair. For eight days after the fire, the city was without
      water, and the dread of a second outbreak hung like a pall over them. The
      city came under military rule, citizens patroled the streets, and every
      stranger was looked upon with suspicion, lest he be an incendiary. General
      Sheridan, by virtue of the fact that he was commander of the Military
      Division of the Missouri, took charge of the city, to protect it from the
      thieves and incendiaries who were at work. He ordered two companies of
      regulars from Omaha, three from Fort Leavenworth, and one from Fort Scott,
      here. General Halleck also furnished him with four companies from
      Kentucky.
    </p>
    <p>
      A hundred men were put to work on the engines of the waterworks, and in a
      week the mains were filled by pumping water into them from the river. Some
      sickness resulted from drinking this water. But eight days' labor resulted
      in forcing water from the pure lake into the pipes, and once more Chicago
      could drink its fill. Meanwhile peddlers had dipped water from the lake
      and sold it from house to house at a shilling a pail. Mayor R. B. Mason,
      on the 10th, forbade any fires kindled for cooking, and &ldquo;cold victuals,&rdquo;
       and in many cases no victuals at all, for a day or so, until the Relief
      Committee could distribute the stores pouring into the desolated city,
      were the order of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then the great heart of the world beat with noble generosity. From
      every city, and town, and village, and from foreign lands, the beneficent
      gifts flowed in, and food and clothing. From New York, Boston, Cincinnati,
      St. Louis, London, England, and all over the world, generous contributions
      of money were poured into Chicago, to feed the starving&mdash;not the
      &ldquo;starving poor,&rdquo; but the starving people, for all were made beggars by the
      <span class="pagenum">[331]</span><a name="link331" id="link331"></a>calamity.
      Banks were destroyed, local fire insurance companies were wiped out of
      existence, and for months our fair city was kept alive by the noble and
      unstinted liberality of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      The loss in property was over $290,000,000, at the lowest estimate. How
      many lives were laid down no statistics have ever been positively given,
      as there was such a large floating population, of whom no account could be
      made, but accepting the lowest computation, at least 250 people perished
      on that fearful night, and over 100,000 were left homeless, and without a
      shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      A writer, speaking of the great loss of the fire of 1871 says that
      $1,000,000 of property was consumed every five minutes, and 125 acres of
      buildings every hour.

      THE JOHNSTOWN FLOOD.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>ly for your lives!
      The dam is going!&rdquo; Such was the warning the inhabitants of the towns
      received from the lips of a man who rode madly through the valley, warning
      every one he saw, on that sad afternoon of May 31, 1889. It was five in
      the afternoon. The people were beginning to think of leaving their <span
      class="pagenum">[332]</span><a name="link332" id="link332"></a>work and
      going to their peaceful homes, when this dread news broke upon their ears.
      They could not credit it, and as they heard the news, they looked
      doubtingly at each other. To most of them, it seemed impossible. The dam
      was away up in the mountains, on private grounds, and few had ever seen it
      or dreamed how vast it was. Besides, they reasoned, it had broken once or
      twice before, and no great harm was done. All these causes served to lull
      their fears. But even when they were warned, it was too late, so impetuous
      was its course. Nothing could have stayed the mad waters in their descent
      into the doomed valley.

    <p>
      The Johnstown flood followed a long rain storm in the Alleghanies&mdash;a
      storm of several days' duration. All the rivers running east were swollen,
      and the immense dam of the huge Conemaugh valley burst with a thunderous
      report. The reservoir was a large one, four miles long by one broad, and
      over seventy feet deep. This vast body of water swept a wave twenty feet
      high at the rate of twenty miles an hour, right down into <span
      class="pagenum">[333]</span><a name="link333" id="link333"></a>the narrow
      and deep valley, where were eight villages boasting a population of
      58,000. Johnstown, Pennsylvania, the largest of the towns in the valley,
      lay at the junction of Stony Creek and the Conemaugh river, and had
      extensive iron works, banks, and many business houses. This and all the
      villages were swept out of being in two hours, so rapid and vehement was
      the coming of the torrent. Thousands were drowned, and nearly two thousand
      people were burned to death by means of a mass of wreckage which was
      caught and held at a new bridge near the town. The houses were all made of
      wood, timber had floated down the current and stacked up, and hundreds of
      trees were piled up at this bridge for a space of sixty acres. It is
      presumed that some furnaces set fire to this mass, and the poor creatures
      whose helpless forms had been entangled in the débris, met an awful death
      by fire. There was no chance for escape; the raging torrent was ready to
      engulf them, while the fierce flames were eager to lap up all that the
      waters spared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Railroad tracks were swept away, telegraph poles leveled, and though
      Philadelphia and other cities sent help and food at once, it was
      impossible to reach the helpless victims for forty-eight hours, and when
      at last soldiers and navvies on rescue trains reached the scene, there was
      nothing to be done but to feed the living and bury the dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearly 10,000 perished, and all who had escaped with their lives tried to
      succor the sufferers, save a few Hungarian Slavs and Italians, who
      plundered the dead, but who were shot at once as a reward for their
      greediness.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not possible to picture the condition of the Valley after the waters
      receded. In many places the whole town was swept as bare as though a
      gigantic broom had passed over it, nothing but sand and gravel being left.
      Where a house chanced to be left standing, it was filled with mud and
      slime to the third story, while trees, broken timbers and debris was piled
      up to the second story. Not a house was fit for occupancy. Dead bodies
      were found in cellars, and in some dwellings horses had been forced into
      the rooms by the rushing waters, and lay there putrefying. <span
      class="pagenum">[334]</span><a name="link334" id="link334"></a>They all
      fared alike. A few citizens were held prisoners in their frame houses, and
      floated over two miles to a place of safety, but these fortunate ones were
      the exception.
    </p>
    <p>
      Medicines, clothing, money and food were liberally poured into the
      unfortunate region. Men and women from all over the country offered their
      services to care for the living and the dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dam whose bursting caused this awful loss of life was very carelessly
      constructed, and had no stone work in its makeup. Indeed, it might well be
      called a vast embankment of earth.

      morning of September 1st, 1886, <span class="pagenum">[335]</span><a
      name="link335" id="link335"></a>gave to the world an account of that
      dreaded convulsion known as an earthquake, which had taken place the night
      previous, just as the hour for retiring had come. The first intimation
      that the Signal Service Bureau at Washington city had of this catastrophe
      was only a surmise. They knew that something was wrong, for communication
      was not to be had. All the telegraph wires were suddenly cut off. Without
      a moment's warning the city had been shocked and rent to its very
      foundation. Hardly a building escaped injury and almost a third of the
      city was in half or total ruins. The whole Atlantic coast was more or less
      affected, and for leagues from the shore the ocean was thrown in a
      turmoil.
    </p>
    <p>
      People fled from the tottering houses to the parks and public squares,
      where they erected tents and remained for weeks, afraid to return to their

      away of great convulsions and that further alarm was unnecessary, so they
      returned home.

      ATING <span class="pagenum">[336]</span><a name="link336" id="link336"></a>from
      the time of the discovery of our continent there have been disturbances
      between the whites and the Indians. The first Indian war was between the
      colonists and the natives, and dates back to 1622.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the beginning of the nineteenth century the Sioux Indians held all the
      lands between the Mississippi and the Rocky Mountains, north of the 40th
      parallel of latitude. These lands were grassy, rolling prairies, with a
      plentiful supply of timber growing along the rivers and creeks which
      abounded. The government established reservations thirty-two years ago for
      the purpose of keeping those Indians who are hostile, separated from the
      peaceably disposed ones, who only went upon the hunt for game for food and
      sale. When buffalo and large game grew scarce, the United States furnished
      them with food and clothing, and placed the means within their power, to
      support themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Indian question is full of interest, and comes forward constantly to
      perplex our government, which regards them as its wards. Articles by the
      hundred have been written about the red man, his possibilities and
      capabilities set forth; plans have been proposed to subdue, or rather
      civilize him, and still the fact remains that the savage nature, save in
      exceptional instances, is as untamed as the first day he came upon the
      scene. <span class="pagenum">[337]</span><a name="link337" id="link337"></a>

      The <span class="pagenum">[338]</span><a name="link338" id="link338"></a>first
      mail to California from the East was carried by the overland route, in
      stages, and lucky was the party that made the lonesome journey across the
      plains unmolested by the Indians, who swarmed about them and sent showers
      of arrows into the coach which was carrying its bag of mail and the
      trembling passengers. The stage was always guarded by United States
      soldiers, but in spite of this the half-naked savages would press closer
      and closer, hurling their sharp arrows with unerring aim, as the stage
      went plunging along, the horses half-mad with fear, but straining every
      nerve to outrun the screaming foe. The settlers of those early days were
      brave men and women, or they would not have risked falling into the hands
      of the roving bands who were always on the war-path on some pretext. Many
      a brave man has died defending the mail which the government intrusted to
      him.

      The Indians have many peculiar customs. One of them is, their habit of
      daubing on the war paint and indulging in a war dance whenever they

      painted faces, and demoniac yells would startle the bravest.
    </p>
    <p>
      September of 1867 the Indians on the North Platte called a council to
      confer with General Sherman. They demanded that the building of several
      roads should be stopped, and particularly the work on the Southern
      Pacific, as it interfered with their hunting. The General would not accede
      to these demands, but promised that any loss they suffered should be made
      good to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      September 18, 1868, the 'Indians attacked our troops at Republican River,
      and Lieutenant Beecher and several other officers were murdered. In 1871
      the Apaches killed over 200 white settlers, not in battle, but skulking in
      ambush, and shooting them wherever they met them.

      The whites met the Indians at Washita River, and defeated them, November
      27, 1868.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the continual outbreaks of the Indians, have been a source of trouble
      and anxiety to the government, which has sought to adjust the claims of
      the red men in a fair and just manner. That the latter have often been
      cheated and robbed by unscrupulous agents and traders, no one can deny,
      but the fact still remains that the Indian nature is peculiarly hard to
      subdue, and their natural instincts are cruel. <span class="pagenum">[343]</span><a

      beauty of civilization, and its beneficial influence upon them.

    <p>
      The Modoc massacre was a cruel return for intended kindness. This tribe
      had for its chief Captain Jack, a very intelligent man of fine abilities.
      Their removal to another reservation was violently resisted by them, and
      they retreated to the Lava Beds, where trouble was anticipated. At last a
      peace council was arranged for and although Colonel Meacham, the peace
      commissioner, urged the whites not to attend it, they paid no attention to
      his warning, but went. The Indians had concealed weapons, and they rose in
      a body, and attempted to massacre every white man present. General Canby
      and Dr. Thomas were killed, and Colonel Meacham received a dozen wounds,
      but survived them. Three months afterward the band surrendered, and
      Captain Jack and some of the other leaders were executed at Fort Klamath,
      Oregon, October 3.

    <h2>
      GEORGE A. CUSTER.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> the close of the
      war of 1861 most of the boys in blue went back to their homes&mdash;but
      not so with General Custer. He was one of the most brilliant soldiers of
      the war, and had the distinction of being the youngest general in the
      army. His graduation from West Point took place just about the first year
      of the conflict, and he was made lieutenant, but before the close of the
      last year he had attained the rank of major-general, and assisted in some
      of the most remarkable victories.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not allowed time to visit his home in Michigan, but was ordered to
      lead a cavalry command through Texas, to teach the people there that the
      war was over, and to check the ravages of the &ldquo;bushwhackers&rdquo; who still
      infested that beautiful State. On his return home he accepted the
      lieutenant-colonelcy of the Seventh United States Cavalry, and nine years
      were passed in service at the frontier posts of Kansas and Dakota.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife lived with him through those scenes of interest. She <span
      class="pagenum">[345]</span><a name="link345" id="link345"></a>had the
      gift of transmitting to paper the vivid pictures of this wild and daring
      life. She passed four months in an army wagon, and rode the long marches
      which her brave husband was forced to make. He was a hero, she also was a
      heroine, for the hardships and privations which she endured so
      uncomplainingly, were worthy of so grand a spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sioux (Soo) is the most powerful tribe of red men on our continent.
      They preyed upon all alike&mdash;with the defenceless settlements of our
      Minnesota frontier, with the Pawnees, the Cheyennes, the Arapahoes, and
      the Shoshones and, indeed, with all the other tribes, far and near.
    </p>
    <p>
      They spared no one. At the end of the war of 1861 our army was called on
      to protect the peaceable settlers of the far West, for the Sioux were more
      hostile and bloodthirsty than ever. For ten years the cavalry regiments
      knew no rest. The Indians were on the war-path continually. They were
      always rash fighters, but when in 1874 they obtained breech-loaders and
      rifles, they became a foe more to be dreaded than ever. They burned our
      forts and massacred the small garrisons in a most atrocious manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our government used every method to subdue them, feeding, clothing and
      coaxing them. Agencies and reservations were placed at good points, but
      this care for their comfort had no effect. The old worn-out Indians, women
      and children lived on these reservations, partaking of the government's
      bounty, while the young and vigorous warriors sallied out to murder and
      pilfer the whites wherever they could find them. The soldiers of the
      United States were not permitted to attack them on their reservations, and
      so they kept out of their way, and escaped punishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      An Indian in his wild state has no respect for another of his race who has
      no scalps to show. There were, however, some who made treaties with the
      whites, and kept them. But among the many who never made any promise to
      behave was a powerful medicine chief known as &ldquo;Sitting Bull.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In March, 1876, General George Crook was sent against this <span
      class="pagenum">[346]</span><a name="link346" id="link346"></a>renowned
      warrior, who had entrenched himself in the hills with 6,000 &ldquo;bad Indians&rdquo;
       around him. From the south General Terry was sent with a strong body of
      cavalry and infantry, and General Gibbon with a small but brave band of
      frontier soldiers. They approached the stronghold of the chief. Major Reno
      left camp to reconnoiter, and was readily convinced how rash it would be
      to attack Sitting Bull, who was daily receiving accessions to his numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Terry thought, however, it was time to start an expedition to
      discover and dislodge the enemy, and he gave the command to the brave and
      fearless soldier, General Custer. He named the 26th of June as the day
      when he and Gibbon would be there to assist Custer, but the latter,
      impatient to open the conflict, had urged his horses and men to their
      utmost so as to reach the scene. He started on the trail with the Seventh
      Cavalry, riding sixty miles in twenty-four hours. His aim was to have a
      bout with the Indians and defeat them single-handed. Coming within sight
      of the village on the left bank of the Little Big Horn River where Sitting
      Bull was encamped, he observed such tokens of excitement and hurrying away
      of ponies as to him had but one explanation&mdash;that the chief and his
      warriors were running away. Dashing forward with panting chest and the
      fire of courage flaming in his face, he placed himself at the head of his
      men, plunged hastily into the valley, and the last that General Reno, who
      followed him closely, ever saw of the brave Custer and his three hundred,
      was the cloud of dust their trail had left behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The valiant Custer had gone to his death! Expecting Reno would make a dash
      such as his own, he had gallantly ridden forward, to be met by a perfect
      storm of flame and lead. In an instant he saw how vain was his attempt,
      and giving orders to mount he sought a way out, but the red men swarmed
      around his followers. Boys and even old squaws were firing at him and his
      band most viciously. <span class="pagenum">[347]</span><a name="link347"      id="link347"></a>

      Vainly they tried to remount&mdash;they cut their horses loose, and on a
      little mound, General Custer, with scarcely a dozen men, all who were
      left, made his last <span class="pagenum">[348]</span><a name="link348"      id="link348"></a>rally. In a few moments all was over. Of the twelve
      troops of the Seventh Cavalry, but one thing escaped alive&mdash;Myles
      Keogh's sorrel horse, Comanche, who came back into the lines a few days
      later, a most pitiable object. Thus perished General Custer, as brave and
      noble a soldier as ever lived!
    </p>
    <p>
      The Utes gave a great amount of trouble in 1879, in Colorado, pouncing
      upon a wagon train and slaying Major Thornburgh and eleven of his men.
      They next murdered Agent Meeker, and carried many women into captivity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Apache Indians fell upon the settlers of Silver City, New Mexico,
      October 19, 1879, killing twenty-one men and women, and seventeen
      children. The men were shot and scalped, and the women tortured. Troops
      were sent to protect the remainder, but it was some time before they could
      be reached.
    </p>
    <p>
      The year 1890 witnessed one of the most serious outbreaks of the red men
      of the Dakota reservations. The Ghost Dance was indulged in, and the
      feeling of dread and fear spread all over the Western country. This dance
      was instigated by Sitting Bull, who had returned to the reservation eleven
      years previous. It has always been a superstition among all the Indians
      that the Messiah would come to them some day, bring all their dead to
      life, and drive the whites out of the land. Sitting Bull encouraged the
      Sioux in Dakota to believe this.
    </p>
    <p>
      At once the War Department was given full control of the Indians by the
      Interior Department. At the different agencies it was found that the
      Indians were stealing cattle and horses and running them off into the Bad
      Lands, where they designed starting a camp. It was well known that if
      Sitting Bull reached that stronghold he would be safe, so the Indian
      police at the Pine Ridge Agency were told to arrest him, which they did,
      and started back to the Agency, knowing a body of cavalry and infantry
      were following in their wake to assist them. But Sitting Bull's friends
      rushed to his assistance and a fierce hand-to-hand encounter took place.
      They all fought like fiends, and lost several of their numbers. But the
      police held the old chief captive, <span class="pagenum">[349]</span><a
      name="link349" id="link349"></a>and two of them shot him&mdash;Bullhead
      and Red Tomahawk. A son of the chief, Crow Foot, was slain also.

      BATTLE OF WOUNDED KNEE CREEK,

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>n the annals of
      American history there cannot be found a battle so fierce, bloody and
      decisive as the fight at Wounded Knee Creek between the Seventh Cavalry
      and Big Foots band of Sioux. It was a stand-up fight of the most desperate
      kind, in which nearly the entire band was annihilated, and although the
      soldiers outnumbered their opponents nearly three to one, the victory was
      won by two troops, about one hundred strong.

      The night before the Indians had agreed to submit, and the troops were up
      bright and early in readiness to move by eight o'clock. At that hour the
      cavalry and dismounted troops were gathered about the Indian village, the
      Hotchkiss guns overlooking the camp not fifty yards away. The Indians were
      ordered to come forward, away from their tents, and when the band, under
      the leadership of Big Foot, walked out of their lodges and formed a
      semicircle in front of the soldiers' tents, there was nothing to indicate
      that they would not submit. Colonel Forsyth, an Indian fighter of tried
      worth, never gave a thought to the chance of a fight. When it was made
      plain to the band that their arms must be <span class="pagenum">[350]</span><a
      name="link350" id="link350"></a>given up, the murmur of discontent was
      unanimous.

    <p>
      When the soldiers proceeded to disarm them and search their tents the
      medicine man jumped up, uttered a loud incantation and fired at a trooper
      standing guard over the captured guns. That was the signal for fight, and
      in a second every buck in the party rose to his feet, cast aside the
      blanket which covered his winchester, and, taking aim, fired directly at
      the troop in front. It was a terrible onslaught, and so sudden that all
      were stunned but, quickly recovering, they opened fire on the enemy. The
      position of troops B and K would not allow their fellow-cavalry-men to
      fire, lest they shoot through the Indians and kill their own men. This the
      terrible duel raged for thirty minutes. Someone ordered &ldquo;Spare the women,&rdquo;
       but the squaws fought like demons and could not be distinguished from the
      men. The entire band was practically slaughtered, and those who escaped to
      the ravine were followed by the cavalry and shot down wherever found. The
      chief medicine man, whose incantations had caused the band to act with
      such murderous treachery, fell with a dozen bullets in his body. It is
      claimed that of the Indians there were but two survivors, one of which was
      a baby girl about three months old, who has since been adopted by a
      wealthy lady in Washington.
    </p>
    <p>
      After <span class="pagenum">[351]</span><a name="link351" id="link351"></a>the
      defeat of the Indians at Wounded Knee Creek, they were ready to close the
      conflict and make the best terms possible with General Miles. On the 22d
      of January there was a grand military review in honor of the victory over
      the redskins. Ten thousand Sioux had a good opportunity to see the
      strength and discipline of the United States Army, the end of the
      ghost-dance rebellion being marked by a review of all the soldiers who had
      taken part in crushing the Indians. Thus passed into history probably not
      only the most remarkable of our Indian wars, but the last one there will
      ever be.

      He was no less renowned as a guide and a soldier. He was a native of
      Madison County, Kentucky, where he was born December 24, 1809. When he was
      a babe his father removed his family to Howard County, Missouri. Here he
      spent <span class="pagenum">[352]</span><a name="link352" id="link352"></a>many
      happy days in hunting wild game, and making himself familiar with nature.
      The schoolroom had not very many charms for him, and at fifteen he was
      apprenticed to a saddler, with whom he remained two years. But this
      employment was irksome to him, and he soon freed himself, and we next hear
      of him as a trapper, which was more congenial to his taste, as he remained
      one for eight years. He next engaged as hunter to Bent's Fort, and eight
      more years glided by. Few men understood the nature of the Indians more
      thoroughly than did he. He dealt with them in a truthful, straightforward
      way, which won their regard, and the government appointed him Indian agent
      in New Mexico, where he was singularly successful in making treaties with
      the red men, which were religiously kept.

      His services during the Civil War were inestimable in New Mexico, Colorado

      There was a long and earnest contest as to what city should have the honor
      of being selected to hold the great World's Fair, St. Louis, Cincinnati,
      New York, Washington and Chicago, each presenting powerful reasons why the
      choice should fall upon it. But Congress settled the question by giving to
      Chicago the coveted honor, and without delay commissioners were chosen,
      and <span class="pagenum">[354]</span><a name="link354" id="link354"></a>officials
      and citizens went busily to work, hand in hand, to make the fair the
      grandest ever projected.
    </p>
    <p>
      The grounds selected were at Jackson Park, Chicago, and comprised 640
      acres. Magnificent buildings were erected, costing from $10,000 to
      $300,000 each, and every State engaged with the others in a friendly
      rivalry. There were forty-seven State and Territorial buildings, each one
      noted for a style of architecture dissimilar to any of the rest, and yet
      all remarkably beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was well represented by foreign peoples, fifty-one nations and
      thirty-nine colonies participating. The edifices erected by the directors,
      such as Transportation, Machinery Hall, Electrical Building, etc., were
      numerous and costly. The beauties of the Art Gallery were a revelation to
      the busy, pushing American, and the man or woman who spent but a few days
      among the wonders of the great World's Fair of 1893 found food for
      reflection and pleasant memories to last a lifetime. Nature was not
      overlooked and the horticultural show was a marvel of beauty. The
      Fisheries Building was deemed among the handsomest on the grounds, costing
      $225,000, but where all were so fine and-so well adapted to their intended
      use, it is impossible to particularize.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fair, it was expected, would be opened by President Cleveland in
      person, but State reasons forbidding his presence, it was arranged that he
      should touch an electric button in Washington which should start the
      machinery here, which was done. The fair was dedicated on the 20th of
      October, 1892, with imposing and lengthy ceremonies, and opened to the
      world in May, 1893.
    </p>
    <p>
      Figures do not appeal to the youthful mind, but still they are necessary
      for comparison, and when I tell my young readers that the Vienna
      exposition in 1873 expended $7,850,000, while Chicago's outlay was
      $17,000,000, it will easily be seen that the Worlds Fair of 1893, held at
      Chicago, was carried out with a magnificence never before equaled.

      HEN <span class="pagenum">[355]</span><a name="link355" id="link355"></a>in
      the campaign of 1896 for President of our great republic, excitement ran
      high, as the &ldquo;silverites&rdquo; had put a candidate in the field in opposition
      to the Republican nominee, the latter party having adopted a platform
      which upheld the gold standard, and which pledged itself to make every
      effort to obtain recognition for silver as money by gold-standard
      countries, at a ratio to be agreed upon later; it also declared in favor
      of a protective tariff.
    </p>
    <p>
      The year of 1893 had brought a terrible panic, which caused more suffering
      in its train, than any that had preceded it. Business was not to be had,
      labor was not sought, and failures were of everyday occurrence. People
      began to ask why this state of affairs existed. The advocates of silver
      answered that it was because that metal was legislated against, while the
      protective tariff people asserted that the troubles were due to the fact
      that the tariff was faulty&mdash;it neither provided money for
      governmental uses, nor work for the toilers.
    </p>
    <p>
      At once a fierce contest of words and arguments began. The silver men
      formed clubs, papers presenting their arguments were scattered all over
      the land, able speakers were employed, and nothing was heard but the
      all-absorbing currency question.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Democrats held a convention at Chicago in July with the silver men in
      the majority. William J. Bryan of Nebraska proved so convincing a speaker
      in the debates, that he held the attention of vast and enthusiastic
      audiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      In return for his efforts <span class="pagenum">[356]</span><a
      name="link356" id="link356"></a>he was nominated for President, and Arthur
      Sewall of Maine for Vice, as William McKinley of Ohio, had been named in
      the Republican body that met at St. Louis, in June, with Garrett A. Hobart
      of New Jersey as Vice-President.
    </p>

    </div>
    <p>
      The platform sanctioned by the party was the free coinage of silver at the
      ratio of &ldquo;sixteen to one,&rdquo; and that the tariff was to remain unchanged.
      The watch 7 word of the party became &ldquo;sixteen to one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the Populists held their convention they chose Mr. Bryan for the
      Presidential chair, and Thomas Watson of Georgia for the position of
      Vice-President. The Silver party indorsed the choice of Bryan, and the
      whole country became engaged in the conflict. The excitement was intense,
      and party spirit ran high. The States seemed equally divided, the Eastern
      and Central coming out for gold, while the Western and Southern espoused
      the claims of the white metal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still another party arose, called the Gold Democrats, who convened at
      Indianapolis in September, and selected John M. Palmer of Illinois for
      their Presidential leader, and Simon B. Buckner of Kentucky for Vice. This
      party came out squarely for the gold standard only.
    </p>

    </div>
    <p>
      Mr. Bryan took the stump and addressed the people of the country at large.
      Mr. McKinley remained quietly in his own home at Canton, and received
      delegations. It seemed as though every man, woman and child took sides in
      the great question at stake, and each was equally sure of success. Debates
      noticeable <span class="pagenum">[357]</span><a name="link357" id="link357"></a>for
      their bitter intensity were heard, meetings were held day and night, and
      each party felt certain that in an acceptance of its particular views
      alone rested the safety and perpetuity of our country.
    </p>
    <p>
      The battle culminated on November 5, 1896, when William McKinley was
      elected by a large majority. The rancor and bitterness died out, all
      parties accepted the people's choice, and he was inaugurated President
      March 4, 1897, amid a scene of splendor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of his patriotism, his clear-sightedness, his wisdom, his administration
      is daily giving proof, and his conduct of our late war with Spain is the
      best vindication of the calm, unbiased, just and grand character of our
      chief executive.

      In <span class="pagenum">[359]</span><a name="link359" id="link359"></a>the
      spring of 1863 two great armies were encamped on either side of the
      Rappahannock River, one dressed in blue and the other dressed in gray. As
      twilight fell, the bands of music on the Union side began to play the
      martial music, &ldquo;The Star Spangled Banner,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Rally Round the Flag;&rdquo; and
      that challenge of music was taken up by those upon the other side, and
      they responded with &ldquo;The Bonnie Blue Flag,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Away Down South in
      Dixie.&rdquo; It was borne in upon the soul of a single soldier in one of those
      bands of music to begin a sweeter and a more tender air, and slowly as he
      played it they joined in a sort of chorus of all the instruments upon the
      Union side, until finally a great and mighty chorus swelled up and down
      our army&mdash;&ldquo;Home, Sweet Home.&rdquo; When they had finished there was no
      challenge yonder, for every band upon that farther shore had taken up the
      lovely air so attuned to all that is holiest and dearest, and one great
      chorus of the two great hosts went up to God; and when they had finished
      the sweet and holy melody, from the boys in gray there came a challenge,
      &ldquo;Three cheers for home!&rdquo; and as they went reverberating through the skies
      from both sides of the river, &ldquo;something upon the soldiers' cheeks washed
      off the stains of powder.&rdquo;

      is death!&mdash;and yet, how wonderful a thing <span class="pagenum">[360]</span><a
      name="link360" id="link360"></a>is life! God appoints it, man develops it,
      death seals its destiny, eternity unfolds its ultimate issues. Each human
      soul in which this power of life is has &ldquo;its secrets and histories and
      marvels of destiny, heaven's splendors are over its dead, hell's terrors
      are under its feet, tragedies and poetries are in it, and a history for
      eternity.&rdquo; Every social organism, every grand national aggregation of
      lives but generalizes the history of the individual, and thus the history
      of all life and of all living, whether in individuals, families, societies
      or nations, is one history, and that history the record of its conflicts,
      its defeats, its victories. The dawn of this life is a struggle for being,
      its growth a constant warfare with antagonisms, its maintenance is by
      continued defenses. And each and all of these create crises of destiny
      which may retard or advance, destroy or establish the whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our national birth was a contest with physical difficulties, our
      establishment a victory over political antagonisms; the last desperate
      struggle was a conflict of ideas, a contest of moral principles; and we
      may hope that its issue shall be one of prosperity and peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mountains are rock-ribbed and enduring because the earthquake has settled
      them on their foundations; the pines that crest them like a coronet
      withstand the rudest blasts, because they have been rooted by the storms
      which toss their giant branches. So universal freedom has been made sure
      by the passing turbulence of rebellion, and our national prosperity
      established by the rude blast of war.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a war such as the world never before witnessed; it was fought by
      such armies as never before were marshaled on the field. But the end has
      come. These great armies have returned covered with honor and laureled
      with renown. They are merged again in the business and activities of life;
      they have disappeared from view like the snow in springtime, or the dew of
      the morning in the <span class="pagenum">[361]</span><a name="link361"      id="link361"></a>summer's sun; now and then the halting step upon the
      sidewalk, here and there an empty sleeve, remind us in our daily walks of
      the stern realities of war.
    </p>
    <p>
      After war, peace!
    </p>
    <p>
      Peace to the dead. Peace through their labors to the living. These &ldquo;have
      fought their last fight,&rdquo; the salvos of artillery which soon shall sound
      from the guns they loved so well shall not awake them. The grass shall
      grow green in springtime, the birds of summer shall sing their sweetest
      notes, the bright glories of autumn shall tint the foliage above them, and
      the white snow of winter shall lie unbroken on their graves, but these
      shall sleep on in peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peace, white-robed and olive-crowned, has come to us who linger. Peace,
      with its cares and toils, peace, with its plenty and prosperity, peace,
      with its duties for to-day and its destinies for to-morrow. Let us welcome
      it and become worthy of it. Let there be in all our lives, thoughts,
      hopes, endeavors, such devotion to duty as called and sent these brave men
      to the battlefield and sustained them there; and then we may safely leave
      our future to the care of those who, coming after us, shall pause, amid
      the ruins time may make, to trace upon the marble in our cemeteries the
      names of the heroic dead.
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      God gives us peace! Not such as lulls to sleep,

      before me like a dream. Again we are in the great struggle for national
      life. We hear the sounds of preparation, the music of the boisterous drum,
      the silver voices of heroic bugles. We see thousands of assemblages, and
      hear the appeals of orators; we see the pale cheeks of women and the <span
      class="pagenum">[362]</span><a name="link362" id="link362"></a>flushed
      faces of men; and in those assemblages we see all the dead whose dust we
      have covered with flowers. We lose sight of them no more. We are with them
      when they enlist in the great army of freedom. We see them part with those
      they love. Some are walking for the last time in quiet, woody places with
      the maidens they adore. We hear the whisperings and the sweet vows of
      eternal love as they lingeringly part forever. Others are bending over
      cradles, kissing babies that are asleep; some are receiving the blessings
      of old men; some are parting with mothers who hold them and press them to
      their hearts again and again, and say nothing, and some are talking with
      wives, and endeavoring with brave words spoken in the old tones to drive
      from their hearts the awful fear. We see them part. We see the wife
      standing in the door, with the babe in her arms&mdash;standing in the
      sunlight sobbing&mdash;at the turn of the road a hand waves&mdash;she
      answers by holding high in her loving hands the child. He is gone, and
      forever. We see them all as they march proudly away under the flaunting
      flags, keeping time to the wild, grand music of war, marching down the
      streets of the great cities, through the towns and across the prairies,
      down to the fields of glory, to do and to die for the eternal right. We go
      with them, one and all. We are by their side on all the gory fields, in
      the hospitals, on all the weary marches. We stand guard with them in the
      wild storm, and under the quiet stars. We are with them in ravines running
      with blood, in the furrows of old fields; we are with them between
      contesting hosts unable to move, wild with thirst, the life ebbing slowly
      away among the withered leaves. We see them pierced by balls and torn with
      shells in the trenches by forts, and in the whirlwind of the charge, where
      men become iron, with nerves of steel.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are with them in the prisons of hatred and famine; but human speech can
      never tell what they endured. We are at home when the news comes that they
      are dead. We see the maiden in the shadow of her first sorrow. We see the
      silvered head of the old man bowed with the first grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      The past rises before us, and we see four millions of human beings
      governed by the lash; we see them bound hand and foot; we hear the strokes
      of cruel whips; we see the hounds tracking women <span class="pagenum">[363]</span><a
      name="link363" id="link363"></a>through the tangled swamps; we see babes
      sold from the breasts of mothers. Cruelty unspeakable! Outrage infinite!
      Four million bodies in chains&mdash;four million souls in fetters. All the
      sacred relations of wife, mother, father and child trampled beneath the
      brutal feet of might. All this was done under our own beautiful banner of
      the free. The past rises before us; we hear the roar and shriek of the
      bursting shell; the broken fetters fall; these heroes died. We look&mdash;instead
      of slaves we see men, women and children. The wand of progress touches the
      auction block, the slave pen, the whipping post, and we see homes and
      firesides, and schoolhouses and books, and where all was want and crime
      and cruelty and fetters, we see the faces of the free. These heroes are
      dead; they died for liberty; they died for us; they are at rest; they
      sleep in the land they made free under the flag they rendered stainless,
      under the solemn pines, the sad hemlocks, the tearful willows and the
      embracing vines; they sleep beneath the shadows of the clouds, careless
      alike of sunshine or storm, each in the windowless palace of rest. Earth
      may run red with other wars, they are at peace. In the midst of battle
      they found the severity of death. I have one sentiment for the soldiers,
      living and dead&mdash;cheers for the living, and tears for the dead.

      brightest of them, Cuba, &ldquo;the Pearl of the Antilles,&rdquo; has been the victim
      of two cruel and merciless wars at her hands, waged with relentless
      barbarity. We could not, as a Christian nation, help protesting against

      THE MAINE DISASTER.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>n the 25th of
      January the Maine, an American battleship, entered the harbor of Havana,
      Cuba, and anchored in her waters at a spot indicated by the harbor-master.
      The usual exchange of salutes and formal visits expected between two
      powers, took place, and there was no apparent unfriendliness shown. Just
      three weeks from that day, in the evening of the 15th of February, an
      explosion took place, which tore the boat to atoms, killing 266 of her
      crew and two officers. At once treachery was suspected, <span
      class="pagenum">[368]</span><a name="link368" id="link368"></a>but the
      American people was asked to suspend its judgment until the long and
      searching investigation which was conducted by the naval board of inquiry
      was ended, when every evidence was produced proving that the awful
      calamity was due wholly to Spanish treachery.
    </p>
    <p>
      This led to a severing of all diplomatic relations, which was ended by the
      Spanish minister's request for his passport. Spain declared war upon the
      United States on April 24, 1898, and it took the House of Representatives
      one minute and forty-one seconds to pass a declaration of war in reply to
      Spain, and the Senate acted with equal promptness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Events of such vast importance have rarely followed each other with such
      rapidity as have those of our late war with Spain. In less than three
      months a nation which deemed itself invincible, threw down the gauntlet
      which was as speedily picked up, and engagements and battles trod almost
      upon each other's heels, until its boast was proved a vain one, and
      victory was ours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our people were ready to accept the challenge. From North and South came
      the glad response. Once more the blue and the gray fought side by side, as
      brothers.

      the afternoon of the same day. The fleet presented a gallant sight, and
      when at three in the morning Admiral Sampson's flagship, the New York,
      flashed forth her signal lights, the answering signals were given from all
      the ships of the fleet, black smoke began to pour from the smokestacks,

      ordered to &ldquo;charge the Block House'&rdquo; and up the hill they charged with
      military precision.
    </p>
    <p>
      After <span class="pagenum">[372]</span><a name="link372" id="link372"></a>the
      Nashville returned to Key West, the rest of the squadron proceeded to the
      Cuban coast. Coming within fifteen miles of Morro Castle, the fleet
      scattered so as to form a complete blockade of the port. Every day brought
      new prizes to our squadron, and the blockade of Havana proved effectual.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is well to call the attention of the boys to a few of the changes in
      phraseology between the old sea terms and the new. Once in the English
      navy (and ours was modeled after it) the term admiral was unknown&mdash;the
      word constable or justice was used. So with the title of captain, which is
      in reality a military one. In the earlier times this personage was called
      a master. The term commodore we have borrowed from that very nation with
      whom we have just measured arms&mdash;the Spanish, and comes from their
      word <i>comendador</i>. Cadets were not known by that name, but were
      called volunteers. Another item which furnishes food for reflection, is
      the origin of the United States navy. On October 13, 1775, the continental
      congress voted to fit out two vessels, one to carry ten guns, the other
      fourteen, for the purpose of taking English supply vessels. The same month
      it added two more vessels to its extensive equipment. On March 27, 1794,
      after our troubles with the Algerine pirates, six frigates were ordered,
      each to carry thirty-two guns. Congress appropriated $700,000 for the
      purpose of organizing a navy. Compare this feeble beginning with our
      splendid navy of to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is proper to explain here what the practice of nations is with regard
      to prize money. It is a strict rule of war that neutral powers must not
      interfere nor give help to either party that is engaged in a war. To
      furnish ships, ammunition, or supplies is a grave offence, and all such
      goods are termed &ldquo;contraband of war.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[373]</span><a

    </h5>
    <p>
      Any boat at sea suspected of carrying &ldquo;contraband&rdquo; articles can be
      searched, but properly commissioned vessels only can perform this duty.
      Another thing which will subject a vessel to being seized or confiscated
      is an attempt at blockade running, or trying to pass the line established
      by the war vessels stationed in an entrance to a harbor or along the
      coast. These are <span class="pagenum">[374]</span><a name="link374"      id="link374"></a>rules of war common to all nations, and must be rigidly
      observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      All neutral governments are notified that such blockade exists, and
      exactly how far it extends. But &ldquo;paper blockades,&rdquo; or the mere declaration
      that a blockade is in force, are of no account. At the treaty of Paris, in
      1856, the powers declared that &ldquo;blockades, in order to be binding, must be
      effective,&rdquo; or in plainer words, a force must actually be stationed on the
      blockaded ground strong enough to make it dangerous to attempt to pass it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prize money&rdquo; sounds very tempting, and its meaning will be given. When a
      war is in progress properly commissioned ships are empowered to capture
      not only the armed vessels of the enemy, but its merchantmen as well.
      These vessels are taken to the country of their captors, the courts pass
      judgment upon their value, and if it is proven to be a lawful prize, it is
      sold, and the proceeds is called &ldquo;prize money,&rdquo; and is awarded to the
      captors, the officers and crew, in proportion to their rank.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prize money adjudged to them is thus given out in the following
      manner:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;1. The commander of a fleet or squadron, one-twentieth part prize money
      awarded to any vessel or vessels under his immediate command.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;2. To the commander of a division of a fleet or squadron, a sum equal to
      one-fiftieth of any prize money awarded to a vessel of the division under
      his command, to be paid from the moiety due the United States, if there be
      such moiety; if not, from the amount awarded the captors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;3. To the fleet captain, one-hundredth part of all prize money awarded to
      any vessel of the fleet in which he is serving, in which case he shall
      share in proportion to his pay, with the other officers and men on board
      such vessel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;4. To the commander of a single vessel, one-tenth of all the prize money
      awarded to the vessel. <span class="pagenum">[375]</span><a name="link375"      id="link375"></a>

      others doing duty on board, and borne upon the <span class="pagenum">[376]</span><a

      respective rates of pay.

    <p>
      &ldquo;All vessels of the navy within signal distance of the vessel making the
      capture, and in such condition as to be able to render, effective aid if
      required, will share, in the prize. Any person temporarily absent from his
      vessel may share in the captures made during his absence. The prize court
      determines what vessel shall share in a prize, and also whether a prize
      was superior or inferior to the vessel or vessels making the capture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The share of prize money awarded to the United States is set apart
      forever as a fund for the payment of pensions to naval officers, seamen
      and marines entitled to pensions.&rdquo;

      and flourishing point, the outlet of the agricultural districts. April 29

      DEWEY'S VICTORY AT MANILA.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he first great
      naval battle of the war took place on the 1st of May. Those whose opinion
      was considered valuable, declared that on this battle depended the result
      of the war&mdash;some even prophesying that a victory here would
      practically end it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another matter which engrossed the attention of the governments abroad,
      was the fact that this encounter would serve as a test of the merits of
      the modern fighting machine. Should it prove all that was claimed for it,
      then in truth, a new departure in naval warfare had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eyes of the world were upon the fleet, which, under the command of
      Commodore George Dewey, was hastening toward Manila, the capital of the
      Philippines. Just after daylight, Sunday morning of May 1, Manila time, 6
      p.m. Saturday, Chicago time, the Olympia opened fire, when two miles away
      from the enemy. As she drew nearer, she trained every battery upon the
      Spanish fleet, with deadly effect. When the battle was almost decided, the
      Reina Christina came out to engage our flagship. <span class="pagenum">[377]</span><a

    <p>
      She <span class="pagenum">[378]</span><a name="link378" id="link378"></a>advanced
      with great bravery, but to no purpose. The big guns on the Olympia struck
      her fore and aft, totally wrecking her and setting fire to her magazine.
      The Spanish Admiral, Montejo, was standing on the bridge of his boat, when
      it was shot from under him. The Spanish sailors escaped into their boats,
      fleeing from the burning ship. Montejo carried his pennant to the
      Castilla, but five minutes after that ship was set on fire by the shells.
    </p>
    <p>
      After two hours' hard fighting, a rest was taken, when the attack was
      renewed, and at the expiration of a half hour the long-dreaded and
      much-boasted of Spanish fleet was a name only&mdash;nothing was left to
      tell the tale of her greatness save the transport Manila.
    </p>
    <p>
      This battle was fought off Cavite, ten miles to the southwest of Manila.
      The Spanish fleet, of which so much was predicted by Spain, and which met
      with such a crushing defeat, consisted of the following vessels: Reina
      Mercedes, cruiser; Reina Christina, cruiser; Isla de Cuba, cruiser; Isla
      de Luzon, cruiser; Castilla, cruiser; Don Antonio De Ulloa, cruiser; Don
      Juan de Austria, cruiser; Velasco, cruiser; Elcano, gunboat; General Lezo,
      gunboat; Marquis del Duero, gunboat; Quiros, gunboat; Villalobos, torpedo
      gunboat; General Alava, transport; Cebu, transport; Manila, transport;
      Isla de Mindanao, converted cruiser.
    </p>
    <p>
      The United States fleet was composed of the Olympia, (flagship),
      first-class cruiser, Captain C. N. Gridley; Baltimore, protected cruiser,
      Captain N. M. Dyer; Boston, protected cruiser, Captain Frank Wildes;
      Raleigh, protected cruiser, Captain J. B. Coghlan; Concord, gunboat,
      Commander Asa Walker; Petrel, gunboat, Commander E. P. Wood; McCulloch,
      dispatch boat; Nanshan, collier; Zafiro, collier. The magnificent victory
      of the American Admiral has made his name famous. His achievement is
      unparalleled in naval annals, and entitles him to the proud rank of being
      the greatest of fleet commanders, a worthy pupil of his invincible
      teacher, David G. Farragut. <span class="pagenum">[379]</span><a

      The gratitude and admiration of the nation are his. President <span
      class="pagenum">[380]</span><a name="link380" id="link380"></a>McKinley,
      as a fitting acknowledgment of his splendid deed, at once appointed him

    <p>
      When the Stars and Stripes were hoisted over the Philippine capital, the
      rejoicings at home were unbounded. But when the news reached Spain, it
      produced a contrary effect; the indignation of that power was profound. An
      uprising of the people was feared, and the governors of all provinces were
      ordered to place them under martial law at the first serious outbreak. The
      cable at Manila was cut by orders of Admiral Dewey, and thus the court at
      Madrid was kept in uncertainty as to what was actually transpiring.
    </p>
    <p>
      The victory so bravely won was but the predecessor of others which gave
      every true American a thrill of pride. Admiral Sampson, commander of the
      North Atlantic squadron, arrived at San Juan de Puerto Rico on the 12th of
      May, making an early call, as he commenced operations before sunrise,
      bombarding the fortifications. The first shot was fired from the Iowa,
      captained by Bob Evans (&ldquo;Fighting Bob&rdquo;), and it was followed by the
      Indiana.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the halyards of the flagship New York the signal flashed forth&mdash;&ldquo;Remember
      the Maine!&rdquo; The big guns pealed forth seven shots, and the works felt
      their force. Fort Morro was left full of gaps, where the shells had struck
      it, and torn away the masonry. The frightened populace fled to the
      interior, beyond the range of the guns. Word had been sent ahead by the
      commander of the American squadron that the works were to be attacked,
      thus giving the non-combatants a chance to seek safety. <span

      The first blood on our side was shed at Cardenas, May 12. After a short
      encounter of thirty-five minutes between the torpedo boat Winslow, the tug
      Hudson and the gunboat Wilmington on the American side, and the batteries
      at Cardenas and four Spanish gunboats, our arms were again victorious.
      Five Americans fell in this engagement. Ensign Worth Bagley of the
      Winslow, a brave North Carolinian, was the first officer to yield up <span
      class="pagenum">[382]</span><a name="link382" id="link382"></a>his life.
      It is stated that even after the Winslow's starboard engine and steering
      gear were useless, the crew kept hurling shot at the Spaniards on shore,
      until she was totally disabled.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the next day, May 13, the Flying Squadron left Hampton Roads, and made
      Key West on the 18th. Santiago was the intended point of attack, and on
      the 18th also Admiral Sampson thought it time to turn his attention to
      that place. The second squadron sent out by Spain, under Cervera, lay at
      that time in the harbor of Santiago, in fancied security.

      ROOSEVELT'S ROUGH RIDERS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>n Friday, June 24,
      a desperate engagement took place between four troops of the First
      Cavalry, four of the Tenth and eight of Roosevelt's &ldquo;Rough Riders,&rdquo; who
      attacked a force of 2,000 Spanish soldiers, twice their number, and
      sixteen men were killed, among whom were Captain Allyn M. Capron and
      Hamilton Fish, Jr., belonging to the Rough Riders.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rough Riders followed the trail over steep hills that towered many
      hundred feet high. The weather was intensely warm, and each man carried
      200 rounds of ammunition and his heavy camp equipment. On they toiled up
      the narrow path, often so narrow that they could only go in single file,
      while the sharp thorns of the prickly cactus tore and scratched them as
      they passed through the thick underbrush.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the day grew hotter they threw away blankets and tent rolls, and even
      emptied their canteens. Soon they heard a call like a cuckoo. Every man
      was on the alert. They knew now that Spaniards were near, for that was
      their cry. A charge was ordered, and they dashed into the thicket. The
      rush was so sudden and bold that a panic ensued among the Spanish
      soldiers, and after fighting about an hour, they fled, firing as they ran,
      leaving fifty dead upon the field. <span class="pagenum">[383]</span><a

      The crack of the Mauser rifles was heard, and the leaves flew from the
      trees and chips from the fence post were showered over the heads of the
      Rough Riders. The fire was a heavy one. Sergeant Fish was the first man to
      fall on our side&mdash;shot through the <span class="pagenum">[384]</span><a
      name="link384" id="link384"></a>heart. Although the enemy was but 200
      yards away, yet they were so securely hidden in the brush that only a
      glimpse of them now and then could be seen. Colonel Wood showed remarkable
      coolness, walking along the lines as he gave orders. Lieutenant Roosevelt
      rushed into the thicket cheering his men on, who were as anxious as he to
      reach the hidden foe. Captain Capron held his revolver in hand, and sent
      several of the Spaniards to the ground. Suddenly his weapon dropped from
      his hands and he fell, shot through the body. With his dying breath he
      cried&mdash;&ldquo;Don't mind me, boys, go on and fight.&rdquo; After fifteen minutes
      more, of hot fighting Lieutenant Roosevelt ordered his men back, and just
      missed a bullet which buried itself in a tree alongside his head. The
      Spaniards fell back, and ran down one hill and up another to the
      blockhouse, it was supposed with the intention of making a stand there.
      Instantly the Americans followed them closely, and poured a storm of
      bullets into the blockhouse; the Spaniards fled in haste, and the battle
      was over. This was the first battle which the Rough Riders had taken part
      in, and they proved their valor and bravery in a brilliant manner.

      HOBSON MADE FAMOUS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>ne of the most
      brilliant exhibitions of pure, unselfish courage ever exhibited was the
      act of Lieutenant Richmond P. Hobson. That officer, who was assistant
      naval constructor, had succeeded in convincing Admiral Sampson that there
      was but one way to prevent Admiral Cervera's escape. His daring scheme
      gave the fleet of the Spanish admiral its death blow. Under the direction
      of Admiral Sampson he volunteered to take the collier Merrimac into the
      channel leading into the harbor, and sink it, so as to prevent his escape
      with his ships; In other words, he literally &ldquo;bottled&rdquo; the unlucky Admiral
      up. <span class="pagenum">[385]</span><a name="link385" id="link385"></a>

    <p>
      He needed but six men to help him accomplish his purpose. Admiral Sampson
      explained to the brave sailors that it was a desperate mission, that death
      was almost certain, and yet when only six volunteers were asked for, over
      1,000 responded, anxious, glad <span class="pagenum">[386]</span><a
      name="link386" id="link386"></a>to be of service to the cause. Tears
      filled their eyes as they begged for the honor of going with the brave
      commander who had been chosen for the perilous undertaking, and dying, if
      need be. It was a gallant deed, and as the Merrimac steamed into the
      channel, a furious cannonading from the Spanish forts greeted their
      coming, but on they went into the &ldquo;very jaws of death,&rdquo; and amid shot and
      shell Lieutenant Hobson went to the point indicated by Admiral Sampson,
      anchored, and swung across the channel. Then a hole was blown in the
      ship's bottom, and a dash was made for a boat. They were loudly cheered by
      the Spaniards, who were lost in admiration of their heroism, and Cervera
      himself, although he took them prisoners, sent a flag of truce to Admiral
      Sampson, by his chief of staff, Captain Oviedo, in honor of their bravery,
      offering to exchange them without delay for Spanish prisoners in the hands
      of the United States.
    </p>
    <p>
      The names of the gallant men who offered their lives so freely were&mdash;Daniel
      Montague, George Charette, J. E. Murphy, Oscar Deignan, John P. Phillips,
      and John Kelly.
    </p>
    <p>
      After being kept prisoners from June 2 until July 6, Lieutenant Hobson and
      the six men who were made prisoners with him, were surrendered by the
      Spanish military authorities in exchange for prisoners which we held.
      Captain Chadwick, of the New York, escorted them through our lines. The
      soldiers were wild with joy, and paid no attention to discipline or order,
      so anxious were they to see the heroes of the Merrimac, whom they wildly
      cheered. Lieutenant Hobson talked very little about his experiences, but
      said the Spanish authorities had treated them well, and their health was
      excellent.

      The bombardment of Santiago's forts was vigorously kept up. On the 22d and
      23d General Shafter landed at Baiquiri, and moved toward Santiago. He
      attacked the Spanish outposts July 1, and a fierce fight raged all day. He
      demanded the surrender of the latter place. General Lawton carried the
      heights of San Juan, after a determined charge.

      victory, and one of the greatest naval battles ever recorded, was the
      total destruction of Cervera's proud fleet, which was accomplished by
      Commodore Schley, on the 3d of July. The American fleet's commander,
      Sampson, was absent conferring with General Shafter regarding future
      movements. Meantime the government at Madrid realized that the city must
      fall sooner or later, and it had ordered Cervera to make one bold dash out
      of the harbor. This he attempted to do, but was received so warmly by
      Schley that in two hours the &ldquo;invincible&rdquo; fleet of the Spanish admiral was
      a series of wrecks, strewn along the beach for fifty miles, with a loss of
      600 killed, and 1,100 prisoners taken by our forces, among whom was
      Cervera himself. The attempted escape was made with great courage on the
      part of the Spaniards, who fought to the last, and when hope was gone,
      threw themselves upon the mercy of their captors, who accorded them
      protection from the Cuban insurgents who had watched the battle in all its
      terrible earnestness.

    <h2>
      SURRENDER OF SANTIAGO.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>antiago had not
      yet yielded, however, and on the 10th of July bombardment of that town was
      resumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 14th of July saw the long-expected surrender of Santiago to General
      Shafter, and at 12 o'clock noon, the glorious Stars and Stripes were
      hoisted over the Governor's palace, and we held the situation. The
      American general rode into the city escorted by the Second Cavalry. The
      people were very quiet, many of them even showing satisfaction at the
      event. Courtesies were exchanged between the Spanish and American
      officers, and General Shafter returned to General Toral his sword. The
      Spanish flag was displaced by the American&mdash;the eternal symbol of
      liberty.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 26th of July the Spanish government made overtures for peace,
      through the French ambassador, M. Cambon, who called on our President and
      by proper authority stated that Spain <span class="pagenum">[388]</span><a
      name="link388" id="link388"></a>was willing to treat with the United
      States, and would like to consider terms. After discussing the proposal
      with the Cabinet, President McKinley notified the French ambassador of his
      ultimatum. The terms of the protocol were these:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;1. That Spain will relinquish all claims of sovereignty over or title to
      Cuba.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;2. That Puerto Rico and other Spanish islands in the West Indies, and an
      island in the Ladrones, to be selected by the United States, shall be
      ceded to the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;3. That the United States will occupy and hold the city, bay, and harbor
      of Manila pending the conclusion of a treaty of peace which shall
      determine the control, disposition and government of the Philippines.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;4. That Cuba, Puerto Rico, and other Spanish islands in the West Indies
      shall be immediately evacuated, and that commissioners to be appointed
      within ten days shall, within thirty days from the signing of the
      protocol, meet at Havana and San Juan, respectively, to arrange and
      execute the details of the evacuation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;5. That the United States and Spain will each appoint not more than five
      commissioners to negotiate and conclude a treaty of peace. The
      commissioners are to meet at Paris not later than the 1st of October.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;6. On the signing of the protocol hostilities will be suspended, and
      notice to that effect will be given as soon as possible by each government
      to the commanders of its military and naval forces.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The government of Spain sought to evade the payment of the Cuban debt, but
      President McKinley was firm, and declined to discuss the matter until
      Spain had accepted his ultimatum. Days passed before our government
      received notification through M. Cambon that the Spanish ministry had
      approved of his management of the negotiations, and he had been authorized
      to sign the protocol. At 4:33 of the same day the agreement was signed by
      Secretary of State Day on behalf of the United States, and M. Cambon, of
      France, on behalf of Spain. <span class="pagenum">[389]</span><a

    <h2>
      SURRENDER OF MANILA.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>ut the latter
      order did not reach Admiral Dewey in time to prevent his adding more
      luster to his name by uniting his naval forces with the land forces of
      General Merritt.
    </p>
    <p>
      July 31 a battle was waged at Malate, a small town half way between Cavite
      and Manila. Here General Greene was posted with 4,000 men. Our troops were
      strengthening their position, when the Spaniards attempted to give the
      Americans a surprise. The rain was pouring down in sheets, the typhoon was
      raging furiously, and it seemed a most auspicious time for the attack.
      Three thousand Spaniards were massed in the vicinity. They forced the
      American pickets in, and assaulted the soldiers in the trenches. But they
      did not know the men they attacked. The Tenth Pennsylvania stood their
      ground, and were reinforced by the First California and two companies of
      the Third Artillery. The mud was up to the axles, the rain and wind raged
      wildly, and the enemy was on top of the trenches, while they sent a
      withering fire into the ranks of the Americans, who never wavered, but
      returned it with earnestness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Spaniards retreated in confusion, but were not pursued, as our
      infantry had exhausted its ammunition. The scene was a thrilling one.
      Darkness covered the earth, save when a flash of lightning lit up the
      faces of the dead and wounded, who lay side by side, in the trenches half
      filled with water which was red with their blood. Not a cry was heard from
      the lips of the wounded, but they spoke words of cheer to those who were
      still able to fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fighting began again August 1, but the enemy kept at long range. The
      next night they made another attack, but were repulsed, <span
      class="pagenum">[391]</span><a name="link391" id="link391"></a>with severe
      loss, 350 killed, 900 wounded, while we lost fourteen, and forty-four
      wounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      August 8, Admiral Dewey and General Merritt notified the authorities in
      Manila that unless they surrendered the city to them in forty-eight hours
      a combined attack by the land and naval forces might be expected. When
      that time had expired the Spanish officials asked one day more so that
      they might remove the women and children, which request was granted.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the foreign warships were appraised of the intended attack, they
      prudently got out of range. The English and Japanese warships joined our
      fleet at Cavite, while the French and German ships went to the north of
      the city, where they were safe. At 9:35 on Saturday, the 13th, a shell was
      fired from the Olympia and hissed dangerously near the fort at Malate. The
      other boats began a rapid fire upon the intrenchments. A few feeble
      replies came from the Spaniards.
    </p>
    <p>
      The battle was short. In half an hour General Greene ordered an advance,
      and six companies of a colored regiment sprang over the breastworks and
      sought the shelter of some hedges about 300 yards from the Spanish lines.
      Then the remaining six companies moved along the shore, partly hid by a
      ridge of sand and at 11 o'clock were in the stronghold.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this critical moment 2,000 Spanish soldiers came on the scene, but they
      did not engage the Americans. As soon as the white flag was seen, General
      Merritt, who had made the steamer Zafiro his headquarters, sent General
      Whittier, with flag lieutenant Brumby to meet the captain general and
      discuss a plan of capitulation. The terms were agreed to by Jaudenes, and
      were as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An agreement for the capitulation of the Philippines:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A provision for disarming the men who remain organized under the command
      of their officers, no parole being exacted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Necessary supplies to be furnished from the captured treasury funds, any
      possible deficiency being made good by the Americans.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The <span class="pagenum">[392]</span><a name="link392" id="link392"></a>safety
      of life and property of the Spanish soldiers and citizens to be guaranteed
      as far as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The question of transporting the troops to Spain to be referred to
      decision of the Washington government, and that of returning their arms to
      the soldiers to be left to the discretion of General Merritt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Banks and similar institutions to continue operations under existing
      regulations, unless these are changed by the United States authorities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At once Lieutenant Brumby hastened away to take down the Spanish flag. Two
      signal men accompanied him. At Fort Santiago, in the north part of the
      city, they, were vigorously hissed when the flag of Spain was hauled down,
      and the flag of the free rose grandly in its place.
    </p>
    <p>
      This day's battle resulted in a loss on the American side of eight killed
      and thirty-four wounded, while the Spanish had 150 killed and 300 wounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Americans captured 11,000 prisoners, 7,000 of them being regulars;
      20,000 Mauser rifles, 3,000 Remingtons, eighteen modern cannon, and many
      of the old pattern.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus ended a war which has covered us with glory&mdash;a war we did not
      invite, but which was forced upon us in the interests of humanity; a war
      which has taught European nations to respect us as a great power. May it
      be the last which our nation is drawn into. May the dawn of peace herald
      the day when wars shall be no more; when wise counsels and generous
      arbitration shall decide questions of moment between nations.
    </p>
    <p>
      War has a terrible meaning; it means desolated homes, and bitter tears
      shed for those who come not; it means angry passions and cruel expressions
      of them; it means want and suffering and the humiliation of defeat for one
      side or the other. May the days of rancor end forever! <span

      ANNEXATION OF HAWAII.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>n connection with
      the war so recently concluded, we should mention the annexation of the
      Hawaiian Islands, a measure which <span class="pagenum">[394]</span><a
      name="link394" id="link394"></a>has been agitated for many years, and the
      conflict only increased the sentiment in favor of making them part and
      parcel of our Republic.
    </p>
    <p>
      The islands comprise a group of eight, and were discovered by Captain Cook
      in 1788. They are important to us from their commercial value, and also
      from their strategic uses, and the necessity for a closer relation has
      been recognized by nearly every President and Secretary of State through
      all the successive administrations.
    </p>
    <p>
      After many long and arduous debates, the vote for and against annexation
      was taken by Congress, and an overwhelming majority declared in favor of
      annexation, and Hayti with her vast commerce, her rich agricultural
      productions became a member of our great body politic, and on Friday,
      August 12, the American flag waved over Honolulu, the capital of the new

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he city of
      Santiago had not yet fallen. Bombarding had, however, long since ceased,
      and negotiations for the peaceful surrender of the city had been going on
      for several days, when General Miles arrived and assumed personal command
      of the army that was massed there. General Shafter of our forces and
      General Toral, of the Spanish, could not easily agree as to terms, but on
      the 16th the conditions of surrender were decided upon. By this agreement,
      about 5,000 square miles, the capital of the province and the entire army
      of Toral, fell to our share.
    </p>
    <p>
      Santiago was ours. The ceremony sealing the surrender was impressive,
      though simple. Early as 9 o'clock the division and brigade commanders
      reported to General Shafter, and all took up the line of march toward the
      city. About halfway, under a lofty tree, General Toral with some of his
      officers awaited their coming. As General Shafter approached this tree the
      Spanish general raised his hat with dignified politeness, and the American
      general returned the bow. Quickly the soldiers of the Spanish side came
      through the hedge, preceded by the king's guard, 200 <span class="pagenum">[395]</span><a
      name="link395" id="link395"></a>strong, <span class="pagenum">[396]</span><a
      name="link396" id="link396"></a>while two trumpeters and a color bearer
      led the column. Marching and countermarching they halted in front of our
      men, and only ten yards away.

    <p>
      Thus they stood, curiosity and excitement plainly visible in their faces,
      although they were motionless as statues. The trumpets then rang out, a
      Spanish officer gave a word of command; their colors were lowered to
      salute ours, they presented arms and their officers removed their hats.
      Captain Brett gave the word, &ldquo;Present sabers,&rdquo; and downward flashed our
      sabers. General Shafter removed his hat, as did his staff. The stillness
      of the morning air was broken by the command of the officer in charge of
      the king's guard, they filed past our soldiers, who presented arms until
      the last man of the guard had gone by. Then the Spaniards marched toward
      Santiago, stacked their rifles which were of the Mauser pattern, and then,
      with neither arms nor flags, went back to their camp. Thus ended
      hostilities around Santiago.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in July the yellow fever began to attack the men of Shafter's army,
      but it was of a mild type, but it would have done incalculable injury had
      not the officers of the Fifth Army Corps addressed a protest to General
      Shafter who sent it to the War Department at Washington. The officials
      there hastened to transport the troops as fast as they could back to the
      United States and sent &ldquo;immunes&rdquo; to Santiago to do garrison duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      An expedition commanded by Major General Nelson A. Miles left the bay of
      Guantanamo July 21, and sailed for Puerto Rico, reaching the port of
      Guanica July 25. This move was intended as a surprise, and a complete one
      it was to the Spaniards, who did not dream of an army of invasion
      attacking them. The naval part of the expedition comprised the Columbia,
      Gloucester, Dixie and Yale, and was in charge of Captain F. J. Higginson.
      General Miles was on board the Yale. The troops were carried by the
      transports, of which there were eight. The Gloucester, with the
      expectation that the harbor was full of mines, went pluckily in, and found
      five fathoms of water very near shore. The first hint of an invading army
      at their door, was <span class="pagenum">[397]</span><a name="link397"      id="link397"></a>the boom of a gun, demanding that the Spanish flag come
      down, from a blockhouse east of the village.
    </p>
    <p>
      They took aim with the next two shots at the hills on either side of the
      bay, so as not to injure the women and children. The Gloucester then laid
      to, and sent a launch on shore, without being molested.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quartermaster Beck sent Yeoman Lacy to haul down the obnoxious flag, and
      up went our glorious Stars and Stripes, the first that ever floated over
      the soil of Puerto Rico.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Spaniards, though apparently making no resistance, suddenly opened
      fire with thirty Mauser rifles. Lieutenant Huse and his men, who had gone
      ashore in the launch, returned the fire with telling effect, their Colt
      gun being equal to the occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without waiting, the Gloucester opened fire with all her armament and
      shelled the town. Lieutenant Huse put up a small fort, calling it Fort
      Wainwright, and laid down barbed wire so as to repel the cavalry attack,
      which he expected. A few of the cavalrymen joined those who were fighting,
      but reinforcements had come for the Americans, and after some more
      vigorous fighting, at 9:45, with the exception of a few scattering shots,
      the town was won, and silence succeeded the din of battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plans of General Miles had been faithfully carried out, and he went
      ashore at noon. He next turned his eyes toward Ponce, determined to shell
      that town if necessary. While he had given the inhabitants of Puerto Rico
      a surprise, he received one in return at the hands of the people of Ponce,
      for when the Wasp steamed up to the shore, instead of a force of soldiers
      arrayed against them, they found everybody in town had turned out, and was
      waiting to receive them with open arms. Ensign Curtin stepped nimbly on
      the beach, as though he did not doubt their sincerity, and was surrounded
      by people forcing presents upon him and his men, and saluting them with
      shouts of welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      A message was sent to the Spanish commander demanding that the town
      surrender, and Colonel San Martin acceded at once upon General Miles'
      assurance that the garrison should be allowed <span class="pagenum">[398]</span><a
      name="link398" id="link398"></a>to leave, that the civil government be
      permitted to continue its functions, that the police and fire brigade
      patrolled without weapons, and that the captain of the post should not be
      held a prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      These conditions were reasonable enough, and were acceded to, and the
      rejoicings of the populace were enthusiastic. It was a genuine ovation,
      and more like a grand festive occasion than the surrender of a town to a
      foe.
    </p>
    <p>
      When General Wilson landed, the local band played &ldquo;The Star Spangled
      Banner.&rdquo; The celebration went on, even after the United States troops
      landed. The people dressed in their finest garments as though it were a
      holiday, and kept open house.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Miles issued a proclamation to the effect that our army came not
      to devastate the land or to interfere with existing laws or customs, and
      all that he required was obedience and order. He told them that the
      military forces were brought there to overthrow the arms of Spain and to
      give them the fullest amount of liberty consistent with the military.
      occupation of their island.
    </p>
    <p>
      An invitation from the city officials at the city hall was given him, and
      when he entered the park which surrounded it, the local band played &ldquo;See,
      the Conquering Hero Comes,&rdquo; to which he responded by taking off his hat,
      and saluting the vast crowd. The band then played several of our national
      airs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The news that peace was near was a disappointment to General Miles, as he
      had planned a masterly movement with great care, and had it been carried
      out it would have taught the Spaniards an invaluable lesson. Puerto Rico
      was occupied with a very small loss&mdash;two killed and thirty-seven
      wounded. <span class="pagenum">[399]</span><a name="link399" id="link399"></a>

    <h2>
      GENERAL FITZHUGH LEE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hen a successor to
      the Cuban consul-generalship was needed, President Cleveland selected
      Fitzhugh Lee for this important post. The health of Ramon Williams, former
      consul-general, had failed so visibly that he could no longer attend to
      its arduous <span class="pagenum">[400]</span><a name="link400"      id="link400"></a>demands, and so in the spring of 1896 the choice of the
      president fell upon Mr. Lee, as the most suitable man for the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fitzhugh Lee was born in Stafford County, Virginia, in 1835, and came of
      an illustrious family. His grandfather had served in the Revolutionary
      war, being the famous &ldquo;Lighthorse Harry,&rdquo; and he himself was the nephew of
      General Robert E. Lee&mdash;both of which facts insure the existence of
      courage and tact in the subject of our present sketch. His wise and
      patriotic administration of the duties of his office as consul won for him
      in a very brief time the confidence and admiration of the entire country,
      and the judgment of Mr. Cleveland was long since indorsed by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      His father was an officer in the navy, but the young boy had no taste for
      a sea-life&mdash;his leaning was toward the army. So to West Point he
      went, from which he graduated in 1856 with a high record, and became a
      lieutenant of cavalry on the frontier, for five years, repelling the
      attacks of the Comanche Indians. He received an arrow in his lungs, in one
      of these engagements, but youth and a good constitution prevailed, and he
      recovered. He became an instructor in cavalry tactics at West Point, when
      only twenty-six years of age. But when the civil war broke out, he
      resigned his commission, and joined the fortunes of the confederacy, where
      his record as a brave and dashing soldier is well known. It is said of him
      that he always showed great coolness and composure, in times of battle,
      never seeming to have any anxiety as to the result. His resolute and
      daring demeanor was contagious, and he was much beloved by the men whom he
      commanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      He is a magnificent horseman. During the war of 1861 he owned a fine mare,
      Nellie, a graceful creature, to whom he was much attached. She was struck
      by a shell at the battle of Winchester, and a fragment of the same shell
      tore her master's leg badly. <span class="pagenum">[401]</span><a
      name="link401" id="link401"></a>

    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0411.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      All through the war he was a fearless, honest adversary, and when peace
      came he retired to his native county, where he led <span class="pagenum">[402]</span><a
      name="link402" id="link402"></a>the quiet, unpretending life of a farmer
      and miller. He was married in 1871, and was peculiarly happy in his home,
      devoted to his wife and children.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1875 he was persuaded to engage in political matters, and was sent to
      the national convention of 1876 as a delegate. Ten years later he was
      elected governor of Virginia and served to the complete satisfaction of
      his people. His political record is as worthy of the man as was his
      military, and no finer example of both can be found. When Mr. Cleveland
      entered upon his second term he made Fitzhugh Lee collector of internal
      revenue, at Lynchburg, Virginia. His official position at Havana remained
      unchanged, when Mr. McKinley entered the executive chair, the latter being
      well aware that no better example of what a brave, cultivated and
      level-headed American gentleman should be, was afforded than by General
      Lee. He was respected by the Spanish officials for his firmness in looking
      after the interests of his countrymen, and his unvarying courtesy to every
      one with whom he came in contact.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was, however, treated with great rudeness on his farewell visit to the
      Spanish Captain-General Blanco, that person refusing to see him, on the
      pretext of being too busy. And when he entered the boat which was to bear
      him to the steamer, the Spanish rabble at the docks showered insulting
      epithets upon him, but with that dignity which is native to him, he paid
      no attention to them, but made the remark that he would be back with
      troops before long, to uphold him.
    </p>
    <p>
      All honor to General Lee. He has proven himself capable of self-control,
      and the man who can govern himself, can govern others successfully. And we
      trust that at some future day this gallant and chivalrous soldier may
      receive some gift at the hands of the nation worthy of his ability.

    <h2>
      ADMIRAL GEORGE DEWEY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>o speak of this
      brave sailor as a hero, is to utter but faint praise. He was born in
      Montpelier, Vermont, sixty-one years ago, and was the youngest of three
      boys. Not one of his elders could have <span class="pagenum">[403]</span><a
      name="link403" id="link403"></a>foreseen, when he was a boy, how proud
      they would become at a future day, of their young townsman. As a boy he
      was full of mischief, loving adventure and ever ready for anything that
      came along. In fact this great man was just like all other boys&mdash;he
      felt the world was his, and all that was in it, to enjoy! At school he
      proved himself an apt student, quick to comprehend his lessons, and a
      ringleader in all kinds of sport, but hating anything small or mean in his
      associates. He was also a great favorite with older people.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came of a prominent family, his father being a doctor, and two of his
      name, both nephews, are said to inherit much of the Dewey talent. When he
      was a lad, the town of Montpelier was very small, but it had great
      pretensions, as it was the capital of the State, and naturally attracted
      the best elements of society, men and women of education and character,
      the former of whom had been chosen to represent the people of the State in
      her legislative halls. In such an atmosphere of culture young Dewey grew
      into manhood, and to his early advantages (his parents holding high social
      standing) he owes that polish of manner which he is said to possess in a
      remarkable degree.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was much of a reader when he was a youth, and the books he read were
      upon naval matters. Sea stories and tales of travel were his delight. It
      is told of him about this time, to show how little he waited for events to
      shape themselves, that he planned to go on a fishing excursion with two
      schoolmates. The hour was to be four in the morning, but he was not to be
      found, and so they started for the river without him. When they reached
      the fishing grounds he had been there two hours, and had an enormous
      string of trout which he had caught. At the time the boys called it
      unfair, but in telling it now, the narrator calls it a good evidence of
      his habit of doing for himself, and not waiting for anyone's prompting. As
      he expressed it,&mdash;&ldquo;You see he didn't wait till next morning before
      going into Manila harbor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His fondness for the water led him to spend his play hours on rafts and on
      an old ferry which was not used by the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once <span class="pagenum">[404]</span><a name="link404" id="link404"></a>he
      thought he'd cross the ferry in an old leaky buggy of his father's. Not
      being able to get the horse into the water, he took the box off the
      running gear and tried to run it across as a boat. He came very near
      drowning, and would have perished but for timely assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      His birthplace has sent forth many notable people, lawyers, doctors,
      statesmen, but of all the renowned names she claims, her greatest boast is
      that Commodore Dewey was born within her limits.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was sent to the military school at Norwich, Vermont, at the age of
      fifteen. Here he stayed two years, at the end of which he concluded that
      he would rather enter the navy than be a land soldier. His father was a
      man of influence, and easily got him appointed at Annapolis.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the year 1858 he graduated, and passed three years of service aboard
      ship before the war of 1861 broke out. He received his commission as
      lieutenant on the 19th of April, 1861, a few days before Fort Sumter was
      fired upon. He was sent at once to the steam sloop Mississippi, which
      joined the West Gulf squadron, and he was with Admiral Farragut when that
      gallant sailor forced an entrance to the Mississippi River.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boat had a hot fight in March, 1863, when it tried to pass the
      Confederate batteries at Port Hudson. A heavy fog prevailed, so dense not
      an object could be seen; they lost their bearings, and ran into shore
      right under the guns of one of their heaviest batteries. They were the
      recipients of 250 shots, which tore the boat from one end to the other,
      but the gloom of the fog proved a blessing, after all, as it enabled the
      crew to take to their boats and escape, after setting their sloop on fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1870 he was given his command, when he did good work on the
      Narragansett. Until 1876 he surveyed the Pacific coast, when he became
      inspector of lighthouses. <span class="pagenum">[405]</span><a

    <p>
      He commanded the Juniata in 1882-83, and was made a captain in September,
      1884, when he took charge of the Dolphin. This boat was one of the four
      vessels comprising the original &ldquo;White Squadron.&rdquo; Honors still flowed in
      upon him, for the next <span class="pagenum">[406]</span><a name="link406"      id="link406"></a>year he took command of the Pensacola, belonging to the
      European squadron, on which he stayed till 1888, when he was made chief of
      the bureau of equipment and recruiting, as Commodore. This position he
      filled until 1893, when he became a member of the lighthouse board.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not until February 28, 1896, that he received the commission of
      Commodore, and in January, 1898, he was placed in command of the Asiatic
      squadron.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it remained for him to eclipse all records in his daring fight at
      Manila, which is probably the greatest naval battle ever fought, and ranks
      its commander among those names that will never be forgotten. The action
      was so brilliant, so decisive, that President McKinley named him for a
      rear admiral in the United States Navy, and the Senate without a
      dissenting voice confirmed the nomination. He deserved it richly, and
      great as is the honor, still greater is the esteem, the love, the
      gratitude of the American nation for this grandest of naval commanders&mdash;George
      Dewey, the generous and manly conqueror on the sea.

      and gallant officer is a native of New York, he having been born at
      Palmyra, that State, fifty-eight years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a boy of very industrious habits. Loving the sea with ardor, his
      sole ambition was to obtain a nautical education. But he was not rich in
      this world's goods, and he could not go to Annapolis unless he could earn
      the money in some way to pay for his training there. So he worked as
      farmer's boy, raking hay and splitting rails, or doing any labor that
      would bring him the coveted reward.
    </p>
    <p>
      But though he was not rich, he had friends who admired his manly spirit,
      and among them was Congressman E. B. Morgan, of New York, who used his
      influence to get him appointed to the naval school toward which his eyes
      so longingly turned. Here he proved worthy of the privilege, and when he
      graduated <span class="pagenum">[407]</span><a name="link407" id="link407"></a>in
      1860, when just twenty years of age, he held the rank of Lieutenant, and
      was put on the frigate Potomac, where he became master, then executive
      officer of the Patapsco. This boat met a hard fate, being blown up in the
      harbor of Charleston in 1865.
    </p>
    <p>
      His promotions came rapidly, first being made Lieutenant-Commander in the
      navy, then Captain, and finally Acting Rear Admiral.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it is not alone as a sea commander that he has won renown. He has
      served as a member of the Board of Fortifications and Defences,
      Superintendent of the Naval Academy at Annapolis, Chief of the Bureau of
      Naval Ordinance, and he was also President of the Maine Board of Inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      He does not enjoy the sweets of domestic life to any great extent, his
      time on shore being so limited; but he is very happily married, and passes
      all of his leisure with his wife, and sons and daughters, in his beautiful
      home in Glenridge, New Jersey.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>mong the &ldquo;boys&rdquo; of
      1861 may be mentioned Admiral Schley, whose deeds have given him a
      world-wide fame. He was of the class of 1860. Winfield Scott Schley was a
      midshipman in the early days of the civil war, and many are the comical
      stories told of his youthful days&mdash;among others, was that this now
      redoubtable commander was dubbed &ldquo;Peggy,&rdquo; owing to the &ldquo;trousers&rdquo; he wore
      in those days, which were excessively peg-topped, or balloon-shaped.
      Another story is that he had a very small foot, No. 5 fitting it easily.
      Of this fact he was boyishly vain. He did duty on the Niagara at that
      period, and his pranks were numerous, for he had a great love of fun, and
      yet was a very orderly, well-disciplined sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      He graduated near the foot of his class, so he could not have been very
      studious, however, his after career has been one series of brilliant
      successes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Commodore Schley was born near Frederick, Maryland, in 1839, and <span
      class="pagenum">[408]</span><a name="link408" id="link408"></a>even as a
      baby came under military influence, for his father, who had served in the
      navy in the war of 1812, was very friendly with General Scott, and named
      the child after that warrior. His early ancestors were stanch Huguenots,
      coming to this country after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, and
      one of them was afterward a Governor of Georgia.
    </p>
    <p>
      He entered the Naval Academy in 1856, remaining there till 1861. He was
      given duty then, being assigned to the frigate Potomac, and a year later
      received command of the Winona, which belonged to the blockading squadron
      of the West Gulf. He knew real war, for he was in many skirmishes on the
      Mississippi, and in July, 1862, became Lieutenant, serving with
      distinction from 1864 to 1866 as executive officer of the Wateree, a steam
      gunboat, at the Pacific station.
    </p>
    <p>
      He received a gold medal from Congress, and the position of Chief of
      Bureau of Equipment from President Arthur, afterward being made Captain,
      for his bravery in rescuing Lieutenant Greeley and six others at Cape
      Sabine, and carrying them safely home.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wedded a lovely young woman, Miss Nannie Franklin, at that time the
      belle of Annapolis. He has two sons, one Frank, an officer in the army,
      the other, Winfield Scott Schley, Jr., is a physician of great repute in
      New York City. His daughter, Virginia, is the wife of an Englishman of

      ENSIGN WORTH BAGLEY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">L</span>ife is sweet to
      all&mdash;especially so to the young. And yet it is sweeter to die for
      one's country; to know that the last throb of the heart beat for the cause
      of liberty and humanity. Such a fate was that of young Ensign Worth
      Bagley, the first officer to fall in our late war with Spain. The life of
      this young man was brief, to have achieved so much; he was only
      twenty-four years old, having been born in Raleigh, North Carolina, on the
      6th of April, 1874. Yet he had known in that short time all of life's
      experiences&mdash;pleasure, pain and honors&mdash;all compressed into the
      <span class="pagenum">[409]</span><a name="link409" id="link409"></a>few
      years of his existence. His father was an editor and a lawyer, and
      enlisted in the first company raised on the Confederate side in the county
      in which he lived. He fought bravely, and never abandoned the fortunes of
      the Confederacy until 1864, when he went home on parole, and was elected
      to the Senate of his State.
    </p>
    <p>
      His son, young Worth, a fitting name for the boy, had cause to be proud of
      his ancestry, on both sides, his father's family being well versed in law,
      politics and business, and his mother's family being originally Quakers.
      She was the daughter of one of the governors of Virginia.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Worth Bagley's boyhood engages the attention of the young, most. He
      grew up under good influences, and as a boy was a model of courtesy and
      gentlemanly bearing; a favorite in the schoolroom or playground, he loved
      his home, and was equally beloved within its walls. Possessed of a noble
      and unselfish nature, how could it be otherwise than that he met
      appreciation? He was a very apt scholar, learning rapidly, and retaining
      it as firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      His father died when he was twelve, and it is a beautiful record that he
      became his mother's comfort. He was the oldest son, and seemed to feel
      that she needed his counsel and protection.
    </p>
    <p>
      When only ten he entered a classical school, with the intention of
      preparing for college. He loved the sea, and was appointed a cadet at the
      naval academy at Annapolis, when he was a little over fifteen, the
      youngest member of his class. How happy he was when he received the
      appointment. He was of a sunny temper, full of jests and laughter, writing
      the most loving letters to his &ldquo;dearest little mother,&rdquo; as he called her.
      He despised anything that took on the character of tattling. &ldquo;Hazing&rdquo; was
      strictly forbidden at the Academy, but he was subjected to it, and when
      called before the commandant and asked the names of the classmen who had
      participated in it, he answered firmly that he meant no disrespect, but he
      considered it dishonorable to tell on his classmates. He was threatened
      with punishment, unless he would tell, but he still refused, <span
      class="pagenum">[410]</span><a name="link410" id="link410"></a>and was
      sent to a ship which was used as a place of severe discipline for cadets
      who disobeyed any of the rules. Here he was kept eighteen days in
      confinement, and possibly he would have remained a good many days longer,
      had not the cadets who had done the hazing confessed their share in it,
      and begged for his release.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the time came for his examination he fell below the mark, and he
      wrote at once to his mother, giving her the reasons for his failure, and
      saying that he hoped the Hon. B. H. Bunn, Member of Congress whose
      influence had secured him the appointment, would use it in his behalf once
      more. Mrs. Bagley took the letter to that gentleman, and he promptly made
      out the papers for the grateful boy. All went smoothly after this, and he
      graduated in the class of 1895, when he was put on the receiving ship
      Vermont, and one month after he went to the cruiser Montgomery. Again he
      was transferred to the Texas in October. On the 20th of January, 1896, he
      was sent to the ill-fated Maine, where he remained six months, then being
      sent back to the Texas, which boat he remained with till he returned to
      Annapolis to take his final examination, which was successful, for he was
      made an ensign on the 1st of July, 1897.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was quite a musician, and sang in the Naval Academy choir. His letters
      home were gems of wit, breathing the most sincere devotion to his friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first service as ensign was on the Indiana, but three months of 1897,
      from August 17 to November 19, were passed on the Maine, as executive
      clerk to Captain Sigsbee. He was then ordered to Baltimore as inspector of
      the Columbian Iron Works, which firm was fitting out the torpedo boat
      Winslow.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Lieutenant Bernadou was given command of this boat he sought for the
      best junior officers, and among the names presented Worth Bagley's stood
      high, but he was reluctant to leave Captain Sigsbee, to whom he was much
      attached, and to whom his services were almost invaluable. But he was
      persuaded to accept the post offered, and on the 28th of December he
      entered on his duties.
    </p>
    <p>
      He <span class="pagenum">[411]</span><a name="link411" id="link411"></a>was
      a hero. He went out in a lifeboat, with two sailors, and rescued two men
      who were adrift on a scow some fifty miles from New York, with a frightful
      storm raging, and brought them aboard. The Secretary of the Navy wrote a
      letter of approval to Lieutenant Bernadou, Ensign Bagley and the crew,
      commending the heroism of all on the Winslow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the fatal engagement in Cardenas Bay, May 11, 1898, the whole world
      knows. He gave his life for his country on that day, without fear or
      flinching, his last words being as cheerful as though it was a holiday.
      There was some delay in heaving the towline and he called out cheerily&mdash;&ldquo;Heave
      her. Let her come&mdash;it's getting pretty warm here.&rdquo; They were the last
      orders this brave and grand young officer ever gave. The next moment the
      bursting of one of the enemy's shells sent Ensign Bagley to his last home.
    </p>
    <p>
      May his life be an incentive to the young, to do their duty in all
      situations and in all places as nobly and faithfully as did this brave
      boy.

    <h2>
      OUR NAVY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>early every one
      understands the terms used in the military branch of service, but since
      the war has had such extensive use for the naval forces, and so many
      engagements have taken place on the sea, it has been the source of much
      perplexity as to the various titles in use by the navy department.
    </p>
    <p>
      When older and wiser heads are puzzled by the many terms, it is necessary
      that our young readers receive a little instruction as to their meaning.
      We therefore give them in full, knowing that the boys (and the girls also)
      will be pleased to learn that officers are divided into two classes&mdash;the
      line or navigating, and fighting officers, and the staff, or specialists,
      such as engineer, medical, pay, construction corps, the civil engineers
      and chaplains. The grades of the line officers are rear admiral,
      commodore, captain, commander, lieutenant-commander, lieutenant,
      lieutenant junior grade, ensign, naval cadet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the staff officers the engineers have three grades&mdash;chief
      engineer, <span class="pagenum">[412]</span><a name="link412" id="link412"></a>passed
      assistant engineer and assistant engineer. The medical corps is divided
      into medical director, medical inspector, surgeon, passed assistant
      surgeon, assistant surgeon. The pay corps includes in order pay directors,
      pay inspectors, paymasters, passed assistant paymasters, assistant
      paymasters. The construction corps comprises naval constructor and
      assistant naval constructor. Then there are the chaplain, civil engineer
      and professor of mathematics. Before one comes to the enlisted men are the
      boatswain, gunner, sailmaker and carpenter; the enlisted men or crew are
      divided into three classes&mdash;seamen, artificers and <i>special</i>
      class.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pay of the officers varies from $500 a year, which the naval cadets
      get, to $6,000 paid rear admirals. Each officer at sea is allowed thirty
      cents a day for rations. This thirty cents he may turn into cash and
      pocket, for officers pay for their food and uniforms out of their own
      salary. If he desires the officer may actually draw the rations instead,
      but most of them prefer their private larder.
    </p>
    <p>
      The enlisted men in the navy are paid from $9 a month&mdash;apprentices of
      the third class&mdash;to $65 or $70 a month&mdash;chief machinists. The
      insignia of their rank worn by the multitude of officers great and small
      is quite bewildering and unintelligible to the uninstructed dweller on
      land, so many and different are the stars, crosses, bands, colors and
      chevrons.

    <h2>
      CONCLUSION.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he authors labors
      are finished; but it is with almost a feeling of sadness that he parts
      company with those for whose pleasure he has told his experiences. In the
      pages of this volume the man has lived again his days of boyhood when his
      heart was aglow with the fire of youth and patriotism, as his country
      called him to the battlefield. Of the many painful scenes, of the tedious
      marches, privations and dangers, that war ever brings, he has told the
      boys and girls who have followed his transcript of those days. Another war
      has been forced upon us, and the man <span class="pagenum">[413]</span><a
      name="link413" id="link413"></a>feels the same ardor burn within his
      breast, the same longing to join the ranks as he did in the far-away days
      of '61.
    </p>
    <p>
      True, this war that has just ended was not so terrible in its aspect as
      was that one which roused his youthful energy, for that was a contest
      between brothers, the late one was between our forces and those of another
      clime, but none the less sad and gloomy were its accompaniments. But one
      glad ray of brightness cheered the gloom. The nation has joined hands and
      those who were once divided have together fought valiantly for one common
      cause&mdash;the honor of their country. From the far-off North and the
      sunny South, the boys in blue and gray have taken up arms and stood side
      by side, equally heroic, equally ready to defend the right. Is not this a
      cause for thankfulness?
    </p>
    <p>
      Shall we not have still greater cause for joy when strife shall cease
      forever&mdash;the strife that brings bloodshed in its train? Will not the
      whole earth be purer and better were it to accept the grand invitation of
      the Czar of all the Russias, to consider a plan by which friendly
      relations shall be established all through the world? He proposes laying
      aside the weapons of war, and disbanding great armies&mdash;thus bringing
      about a time of universal peace, when questions of possession and
      precedence may be decided by arbitration. This noble plan is a step toward
      that brotherhood of nations which alone can make them truly great. No
      exigency could arise which could not be settled by an appeal to the calm
      judgment and love of fair play which would prevail.
    </p>
    <p>
      This beautiful thought is possible, and we welcome the coming of that glad
      day when &ldquo;wars and rumors of wars shall cease.&rdquo;
